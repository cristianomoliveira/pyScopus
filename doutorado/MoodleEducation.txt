Background: Curriculum design and specific topic selection for on-site practical courses in clinical disciplines with limited teaching time is challenging. An electronic learning supported curriculum based on the flipped classroom principle has a high potential to effectively gain knowledge and education along with improving practical experience. Here, we demonstrate the introduction of a flipped classroom curriculum for practical courses in Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) in real world practice to improve the on-site time management and students' experience. Methods: Educational aims of our practical curriculum were analysed and rearranged into a flipped classroom (FC) framework. Core knowledge was taught preliminary based on a moodle platform in predominantly interactive formats. Two quasi-randomized groups were formed with 212 participants either receiving or not receiving access to the e-learning program to reduce a potential allocation bias to the e-learning group. All students completed a questionnaire with learning related items. Focusing the study on the intervention group, we investigated if students using the flipped classroom more often felt better prepared for the practical course. Results: The online learning platform was highly accepted and frequently used by 66% of participating students in the e-learning group. Students with frequent use of our e-learning platform significantly felt better prepared for the practical course (p = 0.001). The far majority of all students supports the idea of further development of e-learning. More than 70% were generally interested in ORL. Handouts were the overall most important learning resource and more than 50% relied solely on them. Conclusions: Flipped classroom curricula can save time and help improving the on-site experience in practical courses especially in smaller surgical disciplines. The acceptance of digital learning is high, and most students rely on handouts for learning ORL, emphasizing the need for guidance by the teacher e.g. through electronic learning. Our results underline the high potential of FC to address teaching challenges for smaller medical disciplines with limited teaching time like ORL. © 2018 The Author(s).

The project InterGEO was carried out with the objective to disseminate knowledge on geomorphological heritage by developing a digital learning platform. It aims at improving students’ autonomy by the reduction of face-to-face teaching and increasing autonomous learning as well as promoting international interactions between students interested in geomorphological heritage. A completely free-access virtual course on geomorphosites was developed with the Learning Management System Moodle. The course is divided into 24 thematic chapters, each of them containing a short description, a list of references and selected publications, as well as other educational material (videos, virtual fieldtrips, etc.). In particular, several videos allow presenting in a dynamic way concepts and examples. The paper presents the tool and its use in academic programmes in six European universities, where it was tested, in various contexts (Bachelors’ and Masters’ programmes; students in geography or geology; general courses in geomorphology and specific courses on geoheritage and geoconservation), before discussing the advantages and challenges the tool is facing. The InterGEO platform is an easy-to-use and friendly educational tool, which allows developing blended learning activities; it is flexible and adaptable in various learning contexts. © 2018, The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage.

This paper reports on a study that examines the learning behaviors and characteristics of students in a mobile applications computer programming class that adopted a “flipped” learning style. By harvesting learning analytics data from a learning management system, we created visualizations of work intensity to explore temporal patterns of students’ behavior and then correlate them with the students’ performance. Findings indicate that low, medium, and high performing students tend to access learning materials late with work intensity spiking on the lecture day, specifically during the lecture session. While high and low performing students show no difference in temporal access to material, medium performing students demonstrate the greatest degree of vibrancy regarding course content material access. Further a discussion of implications and insights on procrastination in the context of flipped classrooms are included. © 2018, The Author(s).

Purpose: Programmes and courses integrating learning and work, captured generally in this paper as work integrated learning (WIL), usually provide flexible and innovative learning opportunities. In a digital age, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be vital in delivering and enhancing such hybrid forms of WIL. The purpose of this paper is to explore the correlation and trajectory of ICT use among priests in the Church of England in the various forms of WIL. Design/methodology/approach: The case study explores ICT use among a sample of Church of England priests by examining initially their use of virtual learning environments (VLEs) such as Blackboard and Moodle in work-based learning (WBL); and assessing the trajectory and correlation to work-related learning (WRL) through their use of social networking/engagement tools such as Facebook and Twitter in continuing professional development courses (CPD). The correlation and trajectory is provided through a document analysis of VLE access and a survey questionnaire. Findings: Priests in WBL and priests engaged in WRL (i.e. CPD courses) revealed a correlation in the lack of ICT pervasiveness. With only a minority of priests engaging in further higher education (HE), the familiarity and use of ICT such as VLE platforms stagnated or declined. Correlated with social networking/engagement, priests overwhelmingly cited the “lack of time” as a reason not to engage with social media, however, ICT reluctance caused by fear was the trajectory resulting in a further lack of “ICT pervasiveness”. Research limitations/implications: While results may be generalisable among Church of England priests and other faith communities internationally, due to its unique and distinctive parameters, it is not generalisable to the general mature student adult education population. Practical implications: The case study highlighted that continued intentional familiarisation and use of ICT within the various forms of WIL programmes and courses among “non-digital natives” would enhance learning. Such learning in WIL would be beneficial for HE programmes addressing e-readiness as a priority. Social implications: Specific to the sample case study, considering the importance of community engagement and WIL, this study highlights the challenges and changes required for improved social capital within the field of ICT and adult education. Originality/value: No studies have considered the training and education of priests as a WIL case study of ICT “pervasiveness” and self-efficacy. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Despite the educational potential of Facebook and Moodle, there are still unanswered questions about their impact on the student learning experience in a well-defined instructional design framework. This study aimed to compare the learning experiences of students who used Moodle (control group) and Facebook (experimental group), in terms of Community of Inquiry (CoI) model presence indicators, that is, cognitive, teaching, and social presence. Several learning activities for the development of learning environments were carried out by ninety-seven (n = 97) students who were enrolled in instructional media design courses in higher education. Findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that students using either Moodle or Facebook as their learning platform had similar perceptions of teaching and cognitive presence; however, Facebook users had a better social presence using the CoI model than their Moodle counterparts. Another point worth noting is that the experimental group’s female participants had better teaching presence, cognitive presence, and overall learning experience than their male peers. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To design any software, students should have the knowledge about the fundamentals of programming language. C-Programming language is important and basic language for all engineering disciplines. It is also prerequisite for other programming languages like C++, Java, C# etc. In present study, we have designed an educational material which is available in the form of Open Educational Resources (OER). OER is teaching, learning and research material that is available freely to reuse, redistribute, remix, retain and revise. Our OER consist of study material like power point presentations, videos, assignments, practice problem statement and quiz in the form of Moodle back up file (.mbz). In the present study, we present how to restore Moodle backup file and how to use this OER at instructor as well as student side. Here OER implementation forAdvanced C Concepts, results and feedback are discussed. © 2018, Rajarambapu Institute of Technology. All rights reserved.

The networking and informatization of education are the inevitable trend of the rapid development of computer technology and educational reform. Compared with other subject education, physical education is less informationalized because of its practicableness. This paper puts forward the idea of sports blended learning based on Moodle platform, aiming at combining web-based learning and traditional physical education so as to promote the reform and development of physical education in colleges and universities. The paper first introduces the research background of Moodle platform and the related theories of blended learning and compares the differences between the college sports blended learning and traditional physical education in terms of teaching process, mode and design. Then based on this, it completes the teaching design based on Moodle platform. At last, it conducts an empirical research on the application of college sports blended learning to badminton teaching, verifying its feasibility and effectiveness in college physical education. © 2018 EDAM.

Introduction: Interventional Radiology (IR) is a medical activity that has experienced an extraordinary growth in the medical field in Spain in recent years. However, there is a lack of visibility in the Spanish Health Administration and the University community, especially among medical students. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine IR knowledge among medical students, preclinical and clinical, in a single University in Spain. Material and Methods: An electronic survey was uploaded (November–December 2017) to an online learning platform (Moodle) and sent to 414 students from second (183 PCs) and fourth (231 Cs) year of medical school. A total of 313 students of 414 (75.6%) answered the survey 142/45.4% PCs and 171/54.6% Cs. Results: Students quantified their knowledge between adequate (41% PCs/80.7% Cs) and poor levels (50.7% PCs/14% Cs). Most of the students suggested that interventional radiologists (IRs) should have a mixed training, surgical and radiological (95% PCs/88.8% Cs). Majority of students indicated that the professionals in charge of carrying out angioplasty were the IRs (95% PCs/83.6% Cs) and only 20.4% PCs/12.8% Cs (P = 0.165) of students chose cardiologists. Almost all of the medical students in both groups said they wanted to know more about IR (99.3% PCs/100.0% Cs), and the majority of students (100.0% PCs/98.8% Cs) said they agree or strongly agree that IR should be taught as an undergraduate medical subject. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that medical students in our University have poor knowledge of IR; however, they are overwhelmingly positive in their desire to have this subject taught as distinct curriculum in medical school. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).

Aims. A lack of neurologists in Latin America forces primary health care providers to manage epilepsy. With the main goal of improving diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with epilepsy through training of physicians in the primary health care level, the International League Against Epilepsy Education Commission (2013–2017) created a low-cost, regional, virtual course. Methods. The course, set-up in Moodle platform, was structured in eight modules, each lasting for a week. Teaching was based on written didactic material, videos, and interactive discussions, both in Spanish and Portuguese. Topics included epidemiology, diagnosis, classification, treatment, prognosis, social issues, and epilepsy policies. Each course was limited to 50 participants and priority was given to general practitioners. Certification was given to those approving the final examination. Results. Since 2015, five courses have been developed, involving 143 participants from 17 countries and 21 tutors. Of the participants, 61% worked in primary health care services. A total of 129 participants (90%) completed the course, and 110 submitted the final examination with an approval rate of 95%. From 85 participants completing the course evaluation, 98% would recommend the course to other colleagues, and 99% showed interest in taking other similar courses. High self-confidence for the management of patients with epilepsy increased from 21% at baseline to 73% after the course. Conclusions. The online course on epilepsy for primary care physicians in Latin America was shown to be a cost-effective course, with good retention and excellent approval rates. Our current challenges include periodic updating, complete self-sustainability, and exploring different strategies to reach our target audience more effectively. © 2018 Epileptic Disorders

The main aim of the present research is to introduce and evaluate the effects of a virtual relationship-building program designed to foster social integration among distance education students. To achieve this purpose, the authors developed a Moodle-based adaptation of Aron et al.'s (1997) “fast-friendship procedure.” The evaluation has employed a longitudinal randomized delayed intervention group design with an additional non-random comparison group (intervention groups: N = 855, comparison group: N = 754). Significant and practically relevant program effects on interpersonal liking and perceived social integration have been confirmed through mixed-model ANOVAs, using multiple comparison groups, individual and dyadic data, and socio-demographic controls. Mediational analyses have further confirmed that program participation had a significant and positive effect on the end-of-semester exam attendance of distance students, mediated by program-induced social integration. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed below. © 2018

Arguments in final course project reports written by engineering students are an essential feature of academic texts. Further revisions of instructors reveal to the students their mistakes, such as a lack of argumentation. However, the depth of revisions is often limited by the time availability of the instructor. In this paper, we present a system for argument assessment embedded in an Internet-based Moodle course with Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard, to help students improve argumentation in the problem statement, justification and conclusion sections of their final project report. The system identifies argumentative paragraphs along with argumentation level and provides recommendations to improve their writing. The analysis is achieved employing machine learning techniques with lexical features trained using an annotated collection of student writings. We performed a pilot test to compare control and experimental groups. Both groups consisted of undergraduate students of computer engineering programs from two different universities. We observed that using the argument assessment system increased the number of arguments in the experimental group. We discuss some further improvements for the system. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Technology has clearly infiltrated all aspects of the education process. In traditional teaching settings, there is an abundance of tools that can assist instructors in delivering their courses, as is evident from the number of available learning management systems (LMS) and other tools. However, LMS platforms are not as well developed for non-traditional teaching techniques in which the students play a bigger role in the learning process. An example of such techniques is the project-based learning (PBL) model where autonomous group work is at the heart of the course delivery and non-conventional assessments are utilized. In this study, we explore the potential and highlight some limitations of adapting Moodle (a popular, open source LMS system) to a PBL environment. We show that Moodle has a potential to leverage the learning process when it is utilized as the main communication platform (student-student and student-instructor) due to the abundance of accessibility and versatility such a tool provides to the instructor and the students. The use of LMS allowed us to better evaluate the course design, monitor student's performance, and communicate expectations with students. This has resulted in improving the course design, assessment, and students learning as was evidenced from the collected assessment data. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The article considers different approaches to the elimination of the lack of professional competencies of graduates in the conditions of a single-industry city located in the Priority Social and Economic Development Area (PSEDA) that establish the most suitable model of the dual education system. The optimization of the competency model of bachelors of engineering specialties in the dual education system for the use in the PSEDA allows reconsidering the approaches to the education of bachelors of engineering specialties to eliminate the deficit of professional and extra-professional competencies of future graduates. This enables students to quickly receive high qualification and obtain practical skills demanded in the labor market. However, it cannot be realized at educational institutions in single-industry cities located far from industrial centers during the education of a general specialist (who has the experience of practical work in various fields of production) and not a focused specialist who is ready to work in one field only without any adaptation period. The structural and functional model of the dual education system was offered that includes the technology of job training reverse for the education of a general specialist in the PSED. This model allows eliminating the lack of professional competencies related to the orientation to one branch of industry in the conditions of a single-industry city together with remote enterprises-partners participating in the "Educational consortium" that teaches using distant learning form realized through the education system Moodle of EIEE TPU (Electronic Information Educational Environment of Tomsk Polytechnic University). © IAEME Publication.

Medical education and pedagogy have undergone a massive change in the 21st century. Still, there is a lack of computer-assisted learning in most of the Pakistani medical schools. Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle), is a user-friendly, online learning management system that is being used globally in teaching online courses to undergraduates, residents and doctoral students. Many international universities and medical institutes have integrated Moodle in their medical education and literature supports the use and importance of such tools. Still very few Pakistani medical schools are utilizing Moodle and similar blended-learning approaches in medical education. We recommend that Pakistani medical schools should consider using Moodle as an online learning platform to promote blended-learning in order to enhance the training of students and faculty, and improving their standards in line with the international standards. © 2018, Pakistan Medical Association.

The article is dedicated to modern learning platforms and e-learning systems designed for educational process management in higher educational establishments. Various relevant global trends in e-learning are described. The article considers the polyparadigmatic approach as the primary methodological approach to develop e-learning courses in mathematics, which has been extended due to the inclusion of e-learning approaches as well as the person-centered approach aimed at individualization of learning. The implementation of e-learning and distance education technologies allows putting completely new forms and methods of teaching into practice. The article also singles out the most convenient learning management systems for developing e-learning courses. Moodle Learning Management System is commonly believed to be a virtual learning environment with huge functionality, being used in universities world-wide. E-learning management process in teaching mathematics at Vienna University of Technology (Austria) and at Siberian Federal University (Russia) is given as an example. It is proved that the implementation of e-learning courses increases the efficiency of independent seatwork as well as brings out completely new opportunities for revealing and developing abilities of students, which will be useful in their future professional life. The article presents the prospects for the development of e-learning by means of creating completely new technological solutions aimed at the development of adaptive learning systems and courses which provide individualization of learning in e-learning environment. © Perspektivy Nauki i Obrazovania.

Millennials interact with technology like no other generation before them and this is affecting how they want to be taught in higher education and how they want to lead and expect to be led in organizations, after graduating. Though stating that they want to be enlightened in academia, some qualitative comments from millennials indicate the opposite, namely that they want to be prepared but also to be kept naïve as to what business really entails. This is expected to help keep motivation levels high, as motivation is seen to be the key element to success in life. Millennials expect also to be led authentically and to be treated as valued human beings. This is in contrast to the current autocratic leadership profile found predominantly in Portuguese organizations, at the time of writing. This study had a sample of one hundred and eleven millennial students who answered a survey on attitudes towards leadership and their desired approach to higher education. Three interviews with seasoned executives were also performed, to establish a contrast and see other perspectives. With this research, we conclude that we may be in the presence of a hard working millennial generation, contrary to previous research findings which has indicated that they are lazy. Finally, information technology (IT) is a precious partner in class, in particular Padlet.com, Moodle, and online News Forums, as well as the challenge to create original videos about course content. Future research should focus on how technology has made society more transparent with employees wanting more democratic leaders in times when hierarchies are seen to hinder rather than aid productivity levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We tested the relative instructional effectiveness of two virtual approaches delivered via a free online training programme: product and process. By product, we mean that learning focuses on analysis of performance, execution, success or final results, which can be measured by indicators such as productivity or quantity of ideas. By processes, we mean that learning focuses on the orchestration, dynamics and deployment of the learner's mental process, and other variables that modulate the acquisition of any skills. To this end, we designed and implemented a virtual instructional skills programme as a free university continuing education course delivered online and lasting 75 hours, using a Learning Management System (LMS), namely the University of Leon's External Moodle, in which 286 people participated. The results indicate that the two virtual approaches designed using the LMS exerted a positive effect on the acquisition of diverse contents, skills and strategies, and an increase was observed in self-efficacy, generalisation, the emotional component, practical application and positive attitudes towards written communication skills. © 2018 Universidad de País Vasco

Love and Fry's research study observed that tutors were underutilizing Blackboard as a repository for core materials. At the time of that research, most students accessed Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) via personal computers. Zainuddin, Idrus, &amp; Jamal posited that VLEs such as Moodle continue to be underutilized as repositories. The literature indicates that the use of mobile technologies to access VLEs trended upward from 2012 onward. We wanted to revisit the results of a 2012 survey administered to 83 undergraduate students studying business at the University of Greenwich. Our analysis explored whether the rise of mobile technologies impacted student interaction with Moodle. Chi-square analysis showed participants’ responses to accessing textbooks as an effective way to revise via mobile devices were associated with whether they believed their use of mobile devices would increase over the next three years χ2 (3) = 7.80, p &lt;.05. Chi-square analysis also showed association between accessing textbooks as an effective way to revise and frequency of accessing the VLE, Moodle χ2 (4) = 13.04, p &lt;.01. The rise of mobile learning devices did not radically alter VLE utilization among this sample. Implications for higher education as a whole are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

This research presents the results of the teaching innovation Dynamic Online Assessment System in Mathematics, which is implemented in higher education to promote self-study by students outside the classroom. The WIRIS calculator was integrated into the Moodle platform to create questions with random elements, for example, students had access to different variants of the same question. The effect of the type of feedback (immediate or deferred) on the work of the students on the platform, measured by means of participation, time spent, and grades obtained, was evaluated. We used a quasi-experimental methodology for a population of 5,507 students, distributed in 229 courses on four campuses that learn Mathematics I in engineering programs. Immediate feedback exhibits better work of students on the platform, but this work is not necessarily more efficient in comparison with the work performed by students using assessments online assessment with deferred feedback. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Aim of the Study: The objective of this study was to compare the immediate and 6-month efficacy of basic life support (BLS) and automatic external defibrillation (AED) training using standard or blended methods. Methods: First-year students of medicine and nursing (n = 129) were randomly assigned to a control group (face-to-face training based on the European Resuscitation Council [ERC] Guidelines) or to an experimental group that trained with a self-training video, a new website, a Moodle platform, an intelligent manikin, and 45 min of instructor presence. Both groups were homogeneous and were evaluated identically. Theoretical knowledge was evaluated using a multi-choice questionnaire (MCQ). Skill performance was evaluated by the instructor's rubric and on a high-fidelity Resusci Anne QCPR manikin. Results: Immediately after the course, there were no statistically significant differences in knowledge between the two groups. The median score of practical evaluation assessed by the instructor was significantly better in the experimental group (8.15, SD 0.93 vs 7.7, SD 1.18; P = 0.02). No differences between groups were found when using a high-fidelity manikin to evaluate chest compressions and lung inflations. At six months, the scores in knowledge and skill performance were significantly lower compared to the evaluations at the end of the instruction, but they remained still higher compared to baseline. The experimental group had higher scores in practical skills evaluated by the instructor than the control group (7.44, SD 1.85 vs 6.10, SD 2.6; P = 0.01). Conclusions: The blended method provides the same or even higher levels of knowledge and skills than standard instruction both immediately after the course and six months later. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The prevalence of technology used in education is evident across many disciplines. Big Data, Massive Open Online Course, and e-Learning are buzz words in educational settings, yet they seem to be non-relevant to the majority of dance educators, especially those teaching dance at secondary level. Overall, the absence of research on technology use in high school dance education creates a void. This ethnographic research is designed to address this issue and to fill the gap by focusing on Generation Z (individuals born after the Millennials) and their teachers in three public high school dance programs in the Greater Toronto area in Canada. While it explores recent studies on technology integration in dance education, it also looks at the effectiveness of using technology, especially how mobile devices work and the role they play in teaching and learning dance. Results indicate that despite initial difficulties, both high school students and their teachers benefit from technology integration in dance classes. Some technological approaches (web podcast and blogs) work better than others (website and virtual learning platforms, e.g. Moodle and Blackboard). Concerns about confidentiality and capability of using technology in dance teaching and learning are discussed and strategies to problem-solving are also shared. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

With its total number of users (around 95 million) throughout the world, it is important to determine the views of academics who use Edmodo the leading SLN. Social Networking Sites (SNS) like Face book, MySpace, Cyworld and Bebo, which allow users to build communities and communicate and collaborate with each other, came out one after another and attracted the attent ions of millions of people. There are a number of studies showing that SNS can be used successfully as a learning environment. The main purpose of SNS is not the field of education, and they lack some useful tools like library, quiz, assignment capacities, and so on, which are the main components of learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle and Blackboard. Moreover, there could also be lots of inappropriate contents in SNS because they are for general use. Because of the wide acceptance of SNS, educational web sites like Edmodo, Ning, and ValuePulse have emerged, which function pretty much like SNS. In the study carried out with the mixed method, the qualitative and quantitative data were collected with an online questionnaire. The findings obtained were interpreted within the framework of cooperative learning and the theories of ―Diffusion of Innovations‖ and ―Uses and Gratifications,‖ and the relat ed themes were formed in Higher education in KRG. © 2018, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Over the past four decades, there has been an exponential increase in veterinary parasitology knowledge, coinciding with the advent of molecular biology in research. Therefore, it is unrealistic for teachers to expect students to graduate with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject. As a result, a new curriculum was introduced at The Royal Veterinary College (University of London) in 2007, designed to meet the needs of our new graduates, i.e. RCVS Day-One Competences. The aims of this curriculum are, inter alia, to ensure that new graduates have an up-to-date body of core knowledge and are able to apply such knowledge and newly-acquired information to scientific and clinical problem-solving. Veterinary parasitology is taught primarily in Year 2, following a brief introduction in Year 1; clinical aspects are covered in Year 3, with original research projects undertaken in Years 4 and 5. Parasitology is taught in parallel with other subjects, enabling both horizontal and vertical integration. Core material is provided in lectures supplemented by directed learning (DL) in small groups and interactive, clinical scenario-based practical classes. Student learning is supported by Moodle 3.2 (Virtual Learning Environment [VLE], RVC Learn) which provides access to an on-line study guide (annotated using Adobe Reader), PowerPoint presentations with synchronized lecturer commentary (Echo Active Learning Platform [ALP]), detailed feedback for DL and practical classes, parasite ‘potcasts’ and CAL packages, and a Clinical Skills Centre. A parasitology textbook has also been published recently to support courses taught at the College. Assessment of student learning is achieved using a variety of written formats (essay, problem-solving questions [PSQ], multiple choice questions [MCQ] and extended matching questions [EMQ]), integrated oral examinations and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). © 2018

The purpose of this article is to analyse teachers’ perceptions of using the modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) platform as a learning management system in a small-scale blended learning (b-learning) Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) programme for in-service secondary school mathematics teachers in South Africa. It describes how the Moodle platform was used in combination with on-campus and later off-campus contact sessions for a widely dispersed population of 76 in-service mathematics teachers over a four-year period. Qualitative data was gathered by means of a questionnaire with open-ended items, while quantitative data was gathered from the centre's archives. The main findings were that Moodle enabled in-service teachers to experience social, cognitive and teaching presences, through synchronous and asynchronous discussions with peers and facilitators, and a teaching presence by submitting their inquiries and assignments online for facilitators to provide them with answers and feedback. The main obstacles to the integration of Moodle were limited availability of technology, slow speed, and unaffordable cost when available. With increased broadband connectivity Moodle holds the prospect for diversifying b-learning experiences that can support teachers’ professional learning outcomes and throughput for distributed populations of practising mathematics teachers, in particular. © 2018 Unisa Press.

This study was designed to explore the effects or roles of usability factors (i.e., perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction) and external support (i.e., teacher and peer support) on undergraduates’ use outcomes of Moodle in a blended learning environment. The research hypotheses derived from relevant constructs taken from the technology acceptance model, information systems continuance model, and the theory of reasoned action. The study's dependent variable is use outcomes, which was conceptualized with factors such as academic performance, perceived learning assistance, and perceived impacts on learning. We conducted a cross-sectional survey and collected data from 126 undergraduate students attending a university in the Maritime region of Canada. The partial least squares technique was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. We found that usability factors have positive effects on students’ use outcomes; contrarily to predictions teacher and peer support did not. The findings of the study offer useful insights that can help HE administrators gain an understanding of antecedent factors likely to enhance students’ use outcomes of Moodle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Education is undergoing profound changes due to permanent technological innovations. This paper reports the results of a pilot study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating the course, "Applicative Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Medicine," upon medical school entry. The Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, introduced a curriculum reform in 2014 that included the implementation of the course, “Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine” for first year medical students. The course was designed using a blended learning format to introduce the concepts of Web-based learning environments. Data regarding student knowledge, use and attitudes towards ICT were prospectively collected for the classes of 2015/16 and 2016/17. The teaching approach was supported by multimedia didactic materials using Moodle LMS. The overall quality of the course was also assessed. The five level Likert scale was used to measure attitudes related to ICT. In total, 1110 students were assessed upon medical school entry. A small number of students (19%) had previous experience with e-learning. Students were largely in agreement that informatics is needed in medical education, and that it is also useful for doctors (4.1±1.0 and 4.1±0.9, respectively). Ability in informatics and use of the Internet in education in the adjusted multivariate regression model were significantly associated with positive student attitudes toward ICT. More than 80% of students stated that they had learned to evaluate medical information and would use the Internet to search medical literature as an additional source for education. The majority of students (77%) agreed that a blended learning approach facilitates access to learning materials and enables time independent learning (72%). Implementing the blended learning course, "Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine," may bridge the gap between medicine and informatics upon medical school entry. Students displayed positive attitudes towards using ICT and gained adequate skills necessary to function effectively in an information-rich environment. © 2018 Milic et al.

This article investigates the importance of critical thinking in English language teaching. It begins with an examination of the notion of praxis and its relevance for current critical literacy research and teacher education programmes. One such programme was a distance-learning course offered to English teachers from Brazilian public schools from November 2016 to November 2017. An analysis of excerpts from posts on Moodle forums and online chats from this course was made in order to ascertain whether participants acknowledge the importance of critical literacy and are able to identify any hindrances to its implementation in the classroom. This article concludes by advocating a post-critical (HOY, 2005) approach to the development of English teachers’ critical praxis, based on the concepts of self-reflexivity and ethics. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Faculdade de Letras.

Although learning indicators are now properly studied and published, it is still very difficult to manage them freely within most distance learning platforms. As all activity indicators need to collect and analyze properly traces of the learning activity, we propose to use these traces as a starting point for a platform independent Trace Based-Indicator Management System (TB-IMS). This approach allows learning indicators to be created and reused in such a way that there is no need to modify the computer code of the learning platform. This paper presents the underlying theory and how this theory is implemented in a first TB-IMS. This TB-IMS is illustrated through an actual learning situation based on a Moodle platform. This approach is compared with similar attempts to manage learning indicators properly and is available for use with any other learning platform, provided the TB-IMS can access the learning platform traces. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The article examines the component composition of the electronic educational and methodological complex in the discipline "Soil mechanics, about the basics and foundations". A description is given of the main elements of the complex, the structure of the course in an electronic environment. The purpose: development of recommendations for creation of an effective electronic educational-methodical complex taking into account specificity of the chosen discipline. The relevance of the chosen research direction is determined by the need to resolve the contradiction between the potential capabilities of the electronic educational and methodological complex in the graduate training system and the insufficiently developed theoretical foundations for their design. The specifics of the electronic educational-methodical complex are analyzed; the main provisions of its construction are covered. Distinctive features are distinguished. Since the legislation does not provide a clear definition of the concept of an electronic educational and methodical complex, we proposed copyright. As an example, we considered a complex developed by a team of teachers from the Minin Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University on the electronic platform Moodle. We discussed in detail and analyzed the contents of each section. By providing a comprehensive impact on students, the course combines the conceptual, illustrative, reference, training and controlling parts and identifies its additional capabilities. And specify the principles on which the first modern electronic educational and methodical s complex and stages of its construction. It is noted that the complex we are considering meets the established requirements, which favors the formation of students as professionals. The results will create an educational and methodical complex is entirely consistent with the requirements of Federal state educational standard with all the features of discipline. © IAEME Publication.

Learning Computational Thinking concepts by all has gained quite importance in last years. Scratch is also one of the most used products to promote it worldwide. Yet, most teachers face difficulties when using it in the classroom with their students. With this idea in mind we developed and run a distance education course under the Project of Distance Education of the University of Coimbra specially designed for elementary school teachers to learn both Computational Thinking concepts and Scratch via an e-learning course using Moodle as a Learning Management System. In this paper we describe this first experience of teaching and learning online, the results obtained and also our future work about this course. Results of this first experience showed that it was possible for the trainees to learn Computational Thinking concepts and Scratch programming and also to develop useful products for their classroom practice using this modality of teaching and learning. As such, a second edition of the course is already planned to take place shortly. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Context: Gamification has been proven to increase engagement and motivation in multiple and different non-game contexts such as healthcare, education, workplace, and marketing, among others. However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design. Objective: This paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology. Method: An easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring. These models contain the event pattern definitions to be automatically transformed into code. This code is then deployed both in a CEP engine to detect the conditions expressed in such patterns and in an enterprise service bus to execute the corresponding pattern actions. Results: The paper reports on the use of both a graphical modeling editor for gamification domain definition and a graphical modeling editor for gamification strategy design, monitoring and code generation in event-based systems. It also shows how the proposal can be used to design and automate the implementation and monitoring of a gamification strategy in an educational domain supported by a well-known Learning Management System (LMS) such as Moodle. Conclusion: It can be concluded that this unprecedented model-driven approach leveraging gamification and CEP technology provides strategy experts with the ability to graphically define gamification strategies, which can be directly transformed into code executable by event-based systems. Therefore, this is a novel solution for bringing CEP closer to any strategy expert, positively influencing the gamification strategy design, implementation and real-time monitoring processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates the impact of web-based blended learning in the physiology course at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Montenegro. The two main goals of the study were: to determine the impact of e-learning on student success in mastering the course, and to assess user satisfaction after the introduction of e-learning. The study compared a group of students who attended the physiology course before, with a group of students who attended the physiology course after the Moodle platform was fully implemented as an educational tool. Formative and summative assessment scores were compared between these two groups. The impact of high vs. low Moodle use on the assessment scores was analyzed. The satisfaction among Moodle users was assessed by the survey. The study found that attendance of face-to-face lectures had a positive impact on academic performance. The introduction of Moodle in the presented model of teaching increased interest of students, attendance of face-to-face lectures, as well as formative and summative scores. High frequency of Moodle use was not always associated with better academic performance, suggesting that the introduction of a new method of teaching was most likely equally accepted by low- and high-achieving students. Most of the students agreed that Moodle was easy to use and it complemented traditional teaching very well, but it could not completely replace traditional face-to-face lectures. The study supports continuing the use of webbased learning in a form of blended learning for physiology, as well as for other courses in medical education. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

Literature abounds with research on the benefits of technology and its effect on students' performance and satisfaction. The use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as blackboard, eCollege, Moodle and others are being used throughout the educational sector. Some even incorporate such technology to measure teaching effectiveness and student performance. Furthermore, social websites, like Facebook.com, have become so popular that 85% to 99% of college students use it in one form or another. This research explores the students' perspective on how the effectiveness of tools such as Moodle and Facebook.com as well as paper based learning (traditional learning) on their performance. The paper also looks at different factors, such as gender, major type and age to try to shed light on the preferred tool among students to use for education. When it comes to students' tool preference based on age and gender, we found no significant difference, but when looking at students' majors and time spent in university, we found that Moodle was rated the top, followed by paper-based learning, then Facebook. When viewing students' perception on effect of these tools on performance, we found no statistical significant difference by age or time spent in the university, but did find a significant difference among different genders; where male students showed greater satisfaction than did female students, and statistical significant different among majors. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.

The integration of e-learning into the educational and training landscape of developed and emerging countries has become an important issue since the beginning of the millennium. The sophistication of associated information technologies tends to replicate all the virtues formerly associated with the face-to-face. Recent advances in interfacing and integration between Learning Management Systems (LMS) and simulators are an example. In Morocco, e-learning is still in a basic level of both practice by practitioners and the place granted to it by governments. Accordingly, the degree of penetration of e-learning is fairly basic both in sophisticated devices and in the sophisticated content that can be able to change the situation. The aim of this article is to study the permeability of Moroccan higher education to e-learning devices and interactive content in particular. The degree of penetration of e-learning and interactive and simulation-based content will be analysed, benchmarked and discussed. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Teaching-learning methods are undergoing rapid transformation in terms of new information and communication technology and in accordance with onset of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The educational environment is being transformed into various forms, with examples being found not only in the existing traditional educational environment, but also in online education and blended learning. Existing online learning (LMS, LCMS) is offered in a limited contents transmission online educational environment, and has been limited but the level of support offered to a learner's personalized learning. This study will overview existing flexible model of contents, suggest possible problems, and attempt to solve these problems. LCMS was designed and realized based on the open source Moodle platform, offering personalized contents to learners. LCMS is composed of the following 3 functions: contents registration of metadata inputted by administrator; search functionality for personalized learner contents; and personalized contents automatically being recommended to learners. As a result of the research, we made online learning environment that can provide customized learning recommendation and self - directed learning by increasing the continuity and efficiency of learning by automatically providing customized online contents to learners. Through this study, the learning of students promises to be effectively initiated by being based on available LCMS functions related to personalized educational contents in online education. © IJASEIT.

Learning management systems (LMS) are web-based platforms used for enhancing and supporting classroom teaching or delivering online instruction. Much of the earlier research has focused on their technological features and implementations into instruction. However, investigating what and how teachers and students think about and experience with LMS based on their actual usage is needed to realize educational potential of these systems. This study aimed to investigate pre-service teachers' lived experiences about taking courses through Moodle LMS. The research was designed as a qualitative study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through content analysis technique via Nvivo 7.0 software. The sample included 25 college students majoring in Computer and Instructional Technology Education at a state university in Turkey. Majority of the participants indicated that Moodle was user-friendly, beneficial and enhancer for interaction with both instructor and course content. Participants identified "assignments", "resources", and "forum" as the most effective instructional modules. On the other hand, some argued that Moodle could not provide face-to-face interaction like in the classrooms and thus it was not suitable for certain math and non-math courses requiring such interaction. They also found registration to course website as the biggest technical challenge. © Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education-TOJDE, 2018.

e-Learning has become increasingly important in chemical education and online exams can be an attractive alternative to traditional exams written on paper, particularly in classes with a large number of students. Ten years ago, we began to set up an e-course complementing our lecture courses Organic Chemistry I and II within the open-source e-learning environment Moodle. In this article, we retrace a number of decisions we took over time, thereby illustrating the challenges one faces when creating online exercises and exams in (organic) chemistry. Special emphasis is put on the development of MOSFECCS (MOlecular Structural Formula Editor and Calculator of Canonical SMILES), our new editor for drawing structural formulae and converting them to alphanumeric SMILES codes that can be submitted as answers to e-problems. Convinced that the possibility for structure input is essential to set up sensible chemistry quizzes and exams, and realising that existing tools present major flaws in an educational context, we decided to embark on the implementation of MOSFECCS which takes into account a number of didactic aspects. © Swiss Chemical Society.

Chemistry is often perceived as being a dry and boring science subject, probably because of traditional teaching method, static textbook, lack of interactivity and difficulty in visualization of the abstract chemical concepts. Elearning resources (e-resources) and the utilization of technology have become one of the major trends in education, replacing the conventional textbook and traditional talk and chalk teaching method. A study was undertaken to assess students' perceptions of the impact of the e-resources and technology on various aspects of their learning. Data were collected through a questionnaire involving 28 undergraduates, who were taking first-year Chemistry course in Taylor's University, Malaysia. A Moodle e-Learning platform was made available to the students, where the students can assess e-resources anytime and anywhere. Innovative technologies such as mobile clicker, simulation and augmented reality (AR) were integrated into classroom instruction. Most of the students found the e-resources provided useful and well prepared them for the assessments in the course. Their understanding and ability to answer questions had improved. They were motivated to study the subject because it was more interactive and engaging. Overall findings showed that these e-resources and innovative technologies gave positive impact on students learning in chemistry. © 2018, International Association of Online Engineering.

Dispensing drug is a moment in which the pharmacist is able to analyze pharmacotherapy and contribute to its rational use. However, research has shown that some pharmacists lack adequate knowledge to perform this service. This study aims to describe a research protocol for a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a distance learning program to train pharmacists in dispensing drugs. This is a protocol for an open diagnostic, non-randomized, single group clinical trial. A 12-week duration distance learning course was structured on the Moodle platform for training community pharmacists who are registered in the Regional Board of Pharmacy and work as employees or owners in Brazilian community pharmacies. The course curricula involves concepts and practice of dispensing drugs applied to the treatment of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and asthma. Pharmacists are divided randomly into groups, to which previously selected tutors give directions to the discussion and clarify questions. A validated questionnaire is being used before and after the course to measure participants’ knowledge. Participant satisfaction with the course is also being measured. Pharmacists who work in the study headquarters municipality receive two visits from a mystery shopper, before and after the course, to evaluate their performance in dispensing drugs. The virtual platform and the content of the course material were evaluated by judges. The study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo. The sample size was estimated to provide desired power for testing the significance of the difference between baseline-to-endpoint change scores. Information about the course is being released through channels such as social networks. The results will be submitted for publication in scientific journals, but information enabling the identification of the study subjects will be kept confidential.

These discussions revealed the knowledge and skills of the FLS students, the expectations of the lecturers and students, and the course objectives. The design process focused on determining Basic English 1 and 2 learning activities and presentation formats for these activities. Each course has a duration of 15 weeks and includes the skills of grammar, reading comprehension, writing, listening comprehension, and speaking. In the development phase, the designers added all the tools from the design phase to the Moodle environment. In the implementation phase, the designers conducted usability tests with the students and identified deficiencies of the design phase. In the evaluation phase, the designers improved the content based on student feedback from the usability tests. Findings: The designers conducted a planned and systematic design process based on the ADDIE instructional design model. At the end of the design process, the course content was transferred to the Moodle environment, and a usability test was administered to the students. The designers revised the environment’s design based on student feedback. Eventually, the study presented an environment that was suitable for blended learning educational activities that mainly used distance education. Implications for Research and Practice: Designing blended learning opportunities for formal learning environments is a rising trend, and the community can benefit from the documented design process. © 2018 Ani Publishing Ltd.

Universities in developing counties have come to understand that relying on only traditional classrooms is not sufficient to advance students' knowledge and skills. The rapid development of information systems and internet technology has brought many educational innovations that can eliminate the boundaries of conventional teaching and learning. However, universities and their members including students are still experiencing challenges in understanding how to access e-learning practically and what type of direct benefits can be gained before e-learning can be implemented at their universities. Consequently, this study develops a pilot program for e-learning content based on quizzes and delivers that content to inexperienced students. The current work aims to measure the effectiveness of e-learning experiences on students after practicing through online quizzes. The findings indicate that students have better grades on their final post-test, which was taken after self-study and practice with online quizzes. All the third-year students (24 students in total) from the Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT), Yangon Technological University (YTU), Myanmar, participated in these pilot e-learning tests. The paper also examines the relationships among e-learning study-time, number of accesses, the number of online activities, the number of quiz activities and the improvements in outcomes of students. The findings of this research will be useful for the universities from Development in establishing e-learning education. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Background: Recent medical education trends encourage the use of teaching strategies that emphasize student centeredness and self-learning. In this context, the use of new educative technologies is stimulated at the Faculty of Medicine of Eduardo Mondlane University (FMUEM) in Mozambique. The Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto (FMUP) and FMUEM have a long-lasting record of collaborative work. Within this framework, both institutions embarked in a partnership, aimed to develop a blended learning course of pathology for undergraduates, shared between the two faculties and incorporating interactive digital microscopy as a central learning tool. Methods: A core team of faculty members from both institutions identified the existing resources and previous experiences in the two faculties. The Moodle course for students from the University of Porto was the basis to implement the current project. The objective was to develop educational modules of mutual interest, designed for e-learning, followed by a voluntary student's survey conducted in FMUEM to get their perception about the process. Results: We selected contents from the pathology curricula of FMUP and FMUEM that were of mutual interest. We next identified and produced new contents for the shared curricula. The implementation involved joint collaboration and training to prepare the new contents, together with building quizzes for self-evaluation. All the practical sessions were based on the use of interactive digital microscopy. The students have reacted enthusiastically to the incorporation of the online component that increased their performance and motivation for pathology learning. For the students in Porto, the major acquisition was the access to slides from infectious diseases as well as autopsy videos. Conclusions: Our study indicates that students benefited from high-quality educational contents, with emphasis on digital microscopy, in a platform generated in a win-win situation for FMUP and FMUEM. © 2018 Journal of Pathology Informatics.

Background: Process mining with educational data has made use of various algorithms for model discovery, principally Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, and Evolutionary Tree Miner. In this study we propose the implementation of a new algorithm for educational data called Inductive Miner. Method: We used data from the interactions of 101 university students in a course given over one semester on the Moodle 2.0 platform. Data was extracted from the platform’s event logs; following preprocessing, the mining was carried out on 21,629 events to discover what models the various algorithms produced and to compare their fitness, precision, simplicity and generalization. Results: The Inductive Miner algorithm produced the best results in the tests on this dataset, especially for fitness, which is the most important criterion in terms of model discovery. In addition, when we weighted the various metrics according to their importance, Inductive Miner continued to produce the best results. Conclusions: Inductive Miner is a new algorithm which, in addition to producing better results than other algorithms using our dataset, also provides valid models which can be interpreted in educational terms. © 2018 Psicothema.

Academic results in mathematics subjects in engineering, especially those taught online, are poor. The key contextual elements of an insufficient level of prior knowledge, poor motivation, and the intrinsic difficulty of the subject matter has led to the review of the study materials and the creation of a methodology based on continuous assessment with automatic feedback at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. The main objective of this article is to present evidence of improved learning outcomes with the application and use of WIRIS quizzes as an automatic assessment tool in calculus subjects. To that end, we carried out descriptive research with an ex-post-facto design, based on statistical analysis of the results for continuous assessment and students’ grades in 11 semesters. The new strategy has been applied in the last two academic years, based on introductory Moodle lessons and assessment with interactive questionnaires. The data obtained are inconclusive: In the first two semesters that the methodology was implemented, the results show a noticeable improvement in several key aspects, such as undertaking and passing the continuous assessment and improved results across the spectrum of grades. However, in the last two semesters, the results are generally similar to those obtained with the old methodology. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper presents an example of open-ended problem solving in the field of chemical reaction engineering using the virtual laboratory (VL) concept. The study was structured as an educational design experiment, which used the VL concept in teaching chemical reaction engineering in the Chemical Engineering degree programme at the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). The artificial reaction system used in the VL assignment consisted of a small set of coupled reactions in a homogeneous medium. The groups communicated with the ‘staff’ of the VL via Moodle's discussion forum feature. The students gave written instructions about how and under what conditions their experiments should be performed. The experiments were conducted by the teacher, who ran the simulations using the parameters the students provided. The VL concept proved to be an efficient method for supporting the students’ ability to execute the various subtasks in reactor design in a professional manner. Students had to explicate their understanding of the task, and they could use their cognitive capacity on problem solving rather than the more technical or practical skills of data acquisition. For the teacher, the method provided an opportunity to scaffold the various student groups at different levels. It also helped to distinguish between groups using concept-based approaches and equation-based approaches and to guide the latter toward the approach used by the former. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

Knowledge sharing and peer learning are important characteristics for learning similar engineering topics, especially suitable for the learning in college. Software design is an advanced required course for software engineering departments. However, most students might have no enough incentives to learn it by themselves. To distinguish the performance of the peer learning, we adopted the peer learning in software design course to analyze the possibility of adoption. Our selected course was a junior major and held on the second semester. Its regulations are declared twice before the due date of the course selection. Students can group their peer learning team by at most three ones, so they can choose as individual learning. Both review and summary quizzes were held at the first and the last 15-min in the Moodle every week, respectively. There were 34 students attending this experiment with four 3-student groups, five 2-student groups, and 12 singles. A web-based tool was designed to illustrate the peer learning performance and students can browse their own score analysis anywhere. Inside the experimental weeks, we found most students attend the course on time. Though the effect of the adopted approach (may be due to too few samples) is not clear, we found evidence from the descriptive statistics and detailed analyses of the experiment results. The peer learning by grouping could have large chance to be better than individual study. It encourages us to adopt the same educational practice to our software design course, even other software related courses. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The development of cocurricular professional skills and capabilities by undergraduates that are linked to formal academic learning is difficult to measure at the program level within higher-education institutions. Feedback from employers, educators, and students suggests that teamwork capability in graduates is highly sought after, but it is hard for students to prove mastery. In the Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSci) program at UNSW Sydney, we initiated a program-wide Comprehensive Teamwork Learning and Assessment (CTLA) model by supporting assessment tasks focused on building teamwork capabilities by combining them with self- and peer-evaluation of teamwork skills awareness and development, ePortfolio implementation, and a teamwork satisfaction survey. These CTLA model elements support student reflective practice and awareness of teamwork skills attainment. Our CTLA model involved tracking, mapping, and selecting assessment tasks that built relevant teamwork skills and incorporated standards-based criteria that directly addressed teamwork skills development using an adapted AAC &U VALUE rubric for teamwork, the UNSW Teamwork Skills Development Framework. This process integrated teamwork learning across all the medical sciences, which included teamwork content knowledge and technical skills that articulated with professional skills development. We implemented this system using Workshop UNSW in Moodle for teachers to monitor and students to evaluate teamwork skills progression for themselves and their peers. Students used ePortfolio/reflective blogging on WordPress to document and reflect on their development of professional teamwork skills as a key part of this approach. Students were surveyed regarding their satisfaction levels at the completion of the teamwork assessment tasks across the program. Study outcomes demonstrated the innovative CTLA model and assessment approaches improved teamwork skills awareness and attainment in the medical science program at UNSW. © Common Ground Research Networks, Lirije Olluri, Sejdi Sejdiu.

This paper attempts to describe the conditions related to the representation of 63 navigational paths carried out on Moodle’s platform. The hypothesis that we advance is that learning styles determine the mode in which users browse through websites. The post-observational notes and the analysis of logs (register of users’ activity) indicate two main facts: on the one hand, the elaboration of a tool that is able to convert log files into graphs that could be visualized as courses of educational browsing. On the other hand, the confirmation of the relation between ways of learning and styles of browsing, giving rise to a method that anticipates choices made by users on the digital platform. There has been stated that assimilative and convergent learning students solve the assigned task consulting, preferably, the content modules on communicative interaction. For their part, accommodating learning students follow precise instructions and rely on his peers’ activity. Finally, divergent learning students tend to prefer collaborative activities and they also help each other. The practical application of the results aims at the usefulness of the findings in university education context, which can be used in the elaboration of quality assessments and the identification of the needs of educational mediation. © 2017, The Author(s).

Integrating Information and Communication Technology into teaching has become the norm of the century due to the influx of electronic gadgets, massification, inadequate traditional equipment and learning space. This study focused on the guidelines necessary for the construction and integration of a traditional course onto a web-based platform for distance learners who were engaged with an e-platform. The distance learners indicated that the elearning mode helped them in acquiring more skills in the use of technology; and more importantly giving them the opportunity to study while working. Though Faculty expressed their views on how their expertise to design and develop courses using instructional design principles were enhanced, they still battled with time to construct the e courses. It was recommended that research into perceptions of Faculty about new technologies in teaching and learning could provide useful ideas into changing academic roles and inform institutional policy on online education and staff development.

The paper reports on a collaborative project on fostering cross-cultural online discussion between two universities with one in Hong Kong and the other in Taiwan. Two online platforms—Moodle as a formal channel for course-related discussion and Facebook as an informal channel for social-oriented interaction—were employed. The study pays special attention to instructional design based on research-derived strategies and reflects on the effects of various strategies as well as students’ experiences and perceptions. The results show that the students perceived the online discussion as valuable for exchanging perspectives and enhancing cross-cultural understanding. However, they were less motivated to use Facebook as the informal channel for socialization. The challenges encountered especially those concerning using Facebook in formal learning environments will be discussed. At the end, the recommendations for better utilizing and bringing together formal and informal online platforms will be suggested. © 2017, The Author(s).

Peer assessment is often used for formative learning, but few studies have examined the validity of group-based peer assessment for the summative evaluation of course assignments. The present study contributes to the literature by using online technology (the course management system Moodle™) to implement structured, summative peer review based on an anchored rubric in an ecological statistics course taught to graduate students. We found that grade discrepancies between students and the instructor were fairly common (60% of assignments), relatively low in value (mean = 3.3 ± 2.5% on assignments that had discrepancies) and proportionally higher for criteria related to interpretation of statistical results and code quality and organisation than for criteria related to the successful completion of analysis or instructional tasks (e.g. fitting particular statistical methods, de-identification of one’s submission). Students reported that the peer assessment process increased their exposure to alternative ways of approaching statistical and computational problem-solving, but there were concerns raised about the fairness of the process and the effectiveness of the group component. We conclude with some recommendations for implementing peer assessment to maximise student learning and satisfaction. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Background: Although blended learning has the potential to enhance the student experience, both in terms of engagement and flexibility, it can be difficult to effectively restructure existing courses. To achieve these goals for an introductory Pathology course, offered to more than 250 undergraduate students at UNSW Sydney, we devised a novel approach. Methods: For each topic presented over 2-3 weeks, a single face-to-face overview lecture was retained. The remaining content that had previously been delivered as conventional lectures was converted into short (12-18 min) online modules. These were based on lecture slides with added animations/highlights, plus narration using edited excerpts of previous lecture recordings. The modules also incorporated interactive questions and review quizzes with feedback which used various question types. Modules were developed in PowerPoint and iSpring and uploaded to Moodle as SCORM packages. Each topic concluded with an interactive large-group session focussing on integration of the content, with in-class questions to which students could respond via the Echo360 Active Learning Platform (ALP). Overall, more than 50% of face-to-face lecture time was replaced by online modules and interactive large-group sessions. Quantitative evaluation data included usage statistics from 264 students and feedback via online survey responses from 41 students. Qualitative evaluation data consisted of reflective commentaries from 160 student ePortfolios, which were analysed to identify factors affecting learning benefits and user acceptability. Results: All of the modules were completed by 74% of students and on average, 83.1% of students eventually passed the optional review quizzes. Notably, 88.4% of students responded to in-class questions during the integration and feedback sessions via the ALP. Student reflections emphasised that the modules promoted understanding, which was reinforced through active learning. The modules were described as enjoyable, motivating and were appreciated for their flexibility, which enabled students to work at their own pace. Conclusions: In transforming this introductory Pathology course, we have demonstrated a model for the use of blended learning in large group teaching sessions, which achieved high levels of completion, satisfaction and value for learning. © 2017 The Author(s).

How to promote engagement and achievement in flipped classroom has been a critical research issue. It has been recognized that a course design enticing students’ behaviour, emotional and cognitive engagements could promote achievement. Among the different types of engagements, behaviour engagement is relatively easier to measure and collect, especially with the help of learning management systems (LMS). This study focuses on the exploration of how online behaviour engagement affects achievement in flipped classroom with a problem-centered learning flow consisting of activation, demonstration, application, and integration. Learning data collected from ten courses was analysed. All the courses were conducted on the Moodle platform, with a total of 488 undergraduate students enrolled from 2010 to 2015 at a university in Taiwan. A model depicting how online behaviour engagement affects achievement was developed using the partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) method. Findings demonstrate that engagement in problem-solving activities has a significant effect on achievement. Furthermore, engagement in self-assessment and self-reflection activities have a significant direct effect on engagement in online studies and social interaction, which in turn have a significant direct effect on engagement in problem-solving activities. Most important of all, the effect of the engagement in self-assessment and self-reflection on achievement is mediated by the engagement in problem-solving activities. Based on these findings, it is argued that the design of attractive and progressive problem-solving activities is at the heart of an effective flipped classroom, and promoting a learning culture of self-reflection and self-assessment helps trigger active engagements in other online learning activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The success of e-learning management systems (e-LMSs) such as MOODLE depends on the usage of students as well as instructor acceptance in a virtual learning environment. E-Learning enables instructors to access educational resources to support traditional classroom teaching. This paper attempts to develop a model to understand and predict the effect of individual characteristics (technology experience [TE] and personal innovativeness [PI]) and e-LMS quality determinants (system quality [SYS-Q], information quality, and service quality) on the continuous use of e-LMS by instructors, which is critical to its success. A total of 219 instructors using MOODLE responded to the survey. The structural equation model (SEM) was employed to test the proposed research model. The SEM results showed that SYS-Q, PI, service quality, and TE have a statistically significant influence on continuous usage of e-LMS by instructors. Furthermore, all determinants of the research model were given as input to an NN model to overcome the simplistic nature of the SEM model. The NN model results showed that service quality is the most important predictor of e-learning acceptance followed by SYS-Q, PI, information quality, and TE. This paper attempts to develop a causal and predictive statistical model for predicting instructor e-LMS acceptance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This article presents a model using peer assessment to evaluate students taking part in blended - learning courses (BL). In these courses, teaching activities are carried out in the form of traditional face-to-face (F2F) and learning activities are performed online via the learning management system Moodle. In the model, the topics of courses are built as a set of projects and case studies for the attending students divided into groups. The result of the implementation of projects is evaluated and ranked by all course participants and is one of the course evaluation criteria for lecturers. To assess learners more precisely, we propose a multi-phase assessment model in evaluating all groups and the group members. The result of each student in the group based on himself evaluation, evaluations of the team members, the tearcher and all students in the course. There are 107 students, who participated in the course entitled “web application development”, are divided into 20 groups conducting the course in the field of information technology is deployed in the form of blended learning through peer assessment. The results of student’s feedback suggested that the usage of various peer assessment created positive learning effectiveness and more interesting learning attitude for students. The survey was conducted with the students through the questionnaire, each question with scale 5-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very statisfied) to investigate the factors: Collaboration, Assessment, Technology showed that students were satisfied with our approach. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Using a mixed methods research approach this study explores faculty perceptions of LORLS at DBS. Data generated by the study will inform advocacy, marketing and training initiatives to promote the platform. The study concludes with a number of deductive and inductive findings. The first is that although DBS faculty are highly predisposed to using LORLS, there are a number of variables that impact its use that must be considered in the context of advocacy, marketing and training activities. Grounded theory analysis of the focus group data also revealed that faculty would like LORLS to have greater interoperability with the virtual learning environment (VLE) Moodle. A key output of the study is a LORLS Process Implementation Chart for proposed inclusion on the LORLS developers' implementation blog to assist other organizations with LORLS adoption. The chart synthesizes the key findings of the literature review and of the data generated in this study. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The paradigm of education has been changed around the globe because of the recent development of smart technology. Thanks to these changes, various web-based course management systems or instructional approaches have been integrated into classroom learning and teaching in order to inspire the study of digital native young generation. This study investigates university students’ learning experiences in using Moodle as the online learning management system which is intended to facilitate flipped learning procedures within the context of English as a foreign language (EFL). Moodle is a web-based learning management system with pedagogical approaches based on constructivism, which emphasizes the roles of shared learning communities, learner-centeredness, and social interaction in the learning context. Flipped learning has been introduced as an effective instructional method which can supplement conventional teacher-centered instruction and help to promote learner-centered learning milieu in language classrooms. Along with the use of Moodle as the learning management system, adopting flipped learning as an effective instructional strategy can accomplish the pedagogical paradigm of constructivism. This paper examines a variety of issues about adopting Moodle as an online learning management system and implementing flipped learning in EFL education. This study also scrutinizes how integrating Moodle into flipped classrooms has improved students’ English language learning and classroom interaction. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.

The development of international cooperation requires cooperation in the sphere of education. An enhanced sharing of experience in the sphere of practical teaching activities implies the increase of the quality of teaching process and of scientific cooperation. Sharing of experience in educational activities implies understanding among representatives of different nations anywhere in the world. It means that through LSM teaching the principle of social constructivism is realized, when participants together create a narrow culture of common objects and senses. The article presents an example of practical application of electronic media to the process of a real lesson. The article describes the process of teaching students from different countries using the system of LMS Moodle, beginning with preparing study materials, giving lectures by foreign lecturers, practical tasks and ending with passing an examination. The training has included some full-time students from the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Dagestan and the Republic of Kazakhstan, and has been realized by applying the method of distance learning (LMS). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Background: Blended learning that combines a modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) with face-to-face teaching was applied to a medical statistics course to improve learning outcomes and evaluate the impact factors of students' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) relating to e-learning. Methods: The same real-name questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention. The summed scores of every part (knowledge, attitude and practice) were calculated using the entropy method. A mixed linear model was fitted using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure to analyse the impact factors of KAP. Results: Educational reform, self-perceived character, registered permanent residence and hours spent online per day were significant impact factors of e-learning knowledge. Introversion and middle type respondents' average scores were higher than those of extroversion type respondents. Regarding e-learning attitudes, educational reform, community number, Internet age and hours spent online per day had a significant impact. Specifically, participants whose Internet age was no greater than 6 years scored 7.00 points lower than those whose Internet age was greater than 10 years. Regarding e-learning behaviour, educational reform and parents' literacy had a significant impact, as the average score increased 10.05 points (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: This educational reform that combined Moodle with a traditional class achieved good results in terms of students' e-learning KAP. Additionally, this type of blended course can be implemented in many other curriculums. © 2017 The Author(s).

Aim: Nutrition professionals in Israel are developing a system to document the Dietetic Care Process (DCP) tailored for specific patient sectors and compliant with national health guidelines. The ultimate goal is to achieve uniform documentation and improve nutrition care. Israeli dietetic practitioners work in specific patient sectors; therefore, a patient population-specific reporting system is proposed instead of the typical singular format applied across all patient populations. The purpose of this project was to evaluate learning outcomes and attitudes among registered dietitians (RDs) after online training of a novel DCP documentation system. Methods: A total of 80 Israeli RDs working in geriatric practice completed an eight-week online educational program learning documentation that is compatible for use with electronic health records and compliant with Israeli standards of practice. A paired sample t-test and McNemar test were used to analyse pre- to post-test performance, while Pearson's r, point-biserial, Spearman's and ANOVA were used to assess relationships among variables. Results: Post-test knowledge scores increased significantly, t (67) = -9.007, P = 0.000; 95% CI (−26.713, −17.019). Age, education, geographic location and previous experience with online courses were not correlated with academic performance, suggesting that demographic characteristics did not impact training. Overall, RDs (&gt;80%) responded positively to the training model and were highly interested in future proficiency online learning opportunities (98%). Conclusions: A sectoral DCP online training program significantly improved knowledge and was rated favourably by Israeli RDs. DCP training for clinical practitioners may be optimised when standardised nutrition care and reporting systems are adapted to specific patient populations. © 2017 Dietitians Association of Australia

E-learning is one of the most fashionable trends in contemporary teaching. It can be defined as an integrated system of education with the central focus placed on the students. Students use given forms of learning - electronic methods for the processing, transmission and storage of information on the creation and delivery of content, activities, problem solving, evaluation, communication, administration and management of education. The aim of creating e-courses in compulsory and optional subjects within the English language for students at Bachelor and Engineer's level at the Faculty of Manufacturing Technologies - in new accredited study programs is not to create a system that does not use traditional education during the semester within language seminars, but such a system, which would meet the requirements of the best foreign language learners and ensure the highest quality of education. © 2017 Marta Gluchmanova.

This article discusses insights gained from a case study on telecollaboration for intercultural communication in foreign language school contexts. Focus was on non-native English and German lingua franca conversations between pairs of students (aged 14–16, B1 level) from schools in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Telecollaboration support included the BigBlueButton video communication platform and Moodle chat. The overall objective was to explore the pedagogical potential of pedagogical lingua franca exchanges via telecollaboration for authentic intercultural communication practice and foreign language competence development beyond the face-to-face classroom. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of oral and written lingua franca conversations and corresponding reflective feedback interviews provided evidence of (a) increased learner agency in connection with communicative participation, topic development, languaging for communicative success and rapport building, and (b) emerging emancipatory qualities of non-native speaker identity including a growing sense of speaker satisfaction and trust in one's own creativity and strategic resourcefulness. The crucial pedagogical key was an open, social constructivist language learning orientation combined with rich opportunities for authentic communication. Intercultural communicative competence development was significantly improved, and transcending the foreign language classroom to include elements of real life became a tangible experience for the students and teachers involved. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Moodle (along with other Learning Management Systems), are widely used within the education sector to facilitate content delivery, marking and student feedback. This paper describes a system which is designed to significantly increase efficiency, accuracy and security whilst reducing feedback latency for a laboratory marking environment. The MoodleNFC system described in this paper seeks to answer the question as to how to most efficiently record marks for students in a laboratory environment by considering aspects of efficiency, accuracy, data integrity and Moodle integration. For large laboratory environments the MoodleNFC system saves significant time by removing the need to search for and select the correct student requiring marking–instead a tutor simply scans a student’s ID card which automatically brings up the student record. The system is evaluated based on measured improvements in efficiency, accuracy and on evaluations completed by users of the system. Compared to a paper-based marking system benchmarking has demonstrated that efficiency increases in the order of 50% are attainable. © 2017 Engineers Australia.

Aim: Learning analytics (LA) is an emerging discipline that aims at analyzing students’ online data in order to improve the learning process and optimize learning environments. It has yet un-explored potential in the field of medical education, which can be particularly helpful in the early prediction and identification of under-achieving students. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative markers collected from students’ online activities that may correlate with students’ final performance and to investigate the possibility of predicting the potential risk of a student failing or dropping out of a course. Methods: This study included 133 students enrolled in a blended medical course where they were free to use the learning management system at their will. We extracted their online activity data using database queries and Moodle plugins. Data included logins, views, forums, time, formative assessment, and communications at different points of time. Five engagement indicators were also calculated which would reflect self-regulation and engagement. Students who scored below 5% over the passing mark were considered to be potentially at risk of under-achieving. Results: At the end of the course, we were able to predict the final grade with 63.5% accuracy, and identify 53.9% of at-risk students. Using a binary logistic model improved prediction to 80.8%. Using data recorded until the mid-course, prediction accuracy was 42.3%. The most important predictors were factors reflecting engagement of the students and the consistency of using the online resources. Conclusions: The analysis of students’ online activities in a blended medical education course by means of LA techniques can help early predict underachieving students, and can be used as an early warning sign for timely intervention. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Although educational online technologies (EOTs) present an extraordinary range of higher education opportunities, significant gaps in knowledge about their purpose and functionality may impede levels of adoption. As the demand for online learning grows, it is critical that tertiary education institutes (TEIs) address gaps in knowledge by developing their understandings of EOT applications. This paper aimed to identify, and describe the application of a range of EOTs popularly used in blended tertiary environments (BTEs). Through qualitatively designed semi-structured interviews with 13 blended learning experts from New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and a 5-step analyses of data, it verified the use of 35 different EOTs in BTEs, including Adobe Connect, Blackboard, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Their key characteristics were summarised using a multi-dimensional taxonomy, called the Pentexonomy, which synergised a range of perspectives into a robust, contextualised, and multidimensional framework for categorising EOTs. An outline of recommendations for the effective use of some of these EOTs was also provided. As EOTs advance and usage accelerates, the outcomes of this research will assist TEIs in their efforts to keep abreast of EOT developments, make informed choices about EOT use, and contribute to the delivery of relevant, meaningful EOT support.

Using computer-based assessments for engineering and other STEM courses is challenging because it requires authentic assessment items that support partial credit, solution composability/traceability, and creative design aspects. Fortunately, learning management systems (LMSs), such as Canvas or Moodle, can be adapted through creative means to deliver more complex assessment options, including incremental solution, multiple answer, design-by-selection, and dynamic cloning. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of STEM assessments and development interfaces, it can be overwhelming for faculty to digitize assessments without sufficient exemplars, deep coaching, and peer assistance. This paper summarizes an immersive faculty development approach designed to address such concerns. The six-week Assessment Digitization Innovation summer workshop covered techniques and principles of digital assessment and associated pedagogical approaches, and was completed by ten instructors in 2016 and seven in 2017. Combined with a stipend, a course release, and the resources of the university's Evaluation and Proficiency Center (EPC), a proctored testing environment allowing students to schedule their quizzes and exams during a testing window specified by the instructor, participants and their teaching assistants were set up to succeed. In post-surveys, they were “very satisfied” with the workshop and agreed that assessment digitization would save time, refocus faculty workloads from low-impact grading to high-impact structured tutoring, improve remediation, and enable them to effectively serve increasing enrollments. Whereas student laptops with lockdown browsers, unused hours of existing computing labs, and dedicated testing centers allow delivery of computer-based assessments using the techniques herein, the methods described can further help to promulgate reduced grading workloads via digitized formative and summative assessments. © 2018 American Society for Engineering Education.

Introduction: Zambia is facing a chronic shortage of health care workers. The paper aimed at understanding how the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) program facilitated strengthening and expanding of the national capacity and quality of medical education as well as processes for retaining faculty in Zambia. Methods: Data generated through documentary review, key informant interviews and observations were analyzed using a thematic approach. Results: The MEPI program triggered the development of new postgraduate programs thereby increasing student enrollment. This was achieved by leveraging of existing and new partnerships with other universities and differentiating the old Master in Public Health into specialized curriculum. Furthermore, the MEPI program improved the capacity and quality of training by facilitating installation and integration of new technology such as the eGranary digital library, E-learning methods and clinical skills laboratory into the Schools. This technology enabled easy access to relevant data or information, quicker turn around of experiments and enhanced data recording, display and analysis features for experiments. The program also facilitated transforming of the academic environment into a more conducive work place through strengthening the Staff Development program and support towards research activities. These activities stimulated work motivation and interest in research by faculty. Meanwhile, these processes were inhibited by the inability to upload all courses on to Moodle as well as inadequate operating procedures and feedback mechanisms for the Moodle. Conclusion: Expansion and improvement in training processes for health care workers requires targeted investment within medical institutions and strengthening local and international partnerships. © Charles Michelo et al.

The search for ways to empower end users in activities such as programming and application customization has been subject of great effort among the research community, leading to the development of EUD environments, proper for end user's activities. Among such environments there are the ones that have multiple layers of (distinct) users, consequently allowing multiple customizations. As an example, we have the Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), with focus on education. In the particular case of VLEs, we are interested in verifying the discourse continuity after multiple customizations by many users, looking at how it impacts on teacher's self-expression at the end of this chain, and how this expression is perceived by the students while interacting with the product of their teacher's effort. This is part of a qualitative and descriptive evaluation with theoretical fundamentals on the Semiotic Engineering theory, the self-expression phenomenon, and end-user development practices. We have conducted three studies using Moodle as the VLE of choice. The first one identified three ways by which teachers practice self-expression via Moodle: through written language, interface customization, and expression through content, and Study 2 revealed that students perceive these same ways of expression. Finally, the inspections and the analyses of the interviews and questionnaires applied during Study 3 have confirmed these results, even after many customizations. That is, the teacher's self (e.g., personality) is present and recognizable via interface. By taking EUD under the perspective of the Semiotic Engineering theory and self-expression, we were able to study the metacommunication intrinsic to multilevel customization software such as Moodle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) uses the Moodle learning management system for formative and summative computer assessment. The authors of this article-the teacher primarily responsible for Moodle implementation and a researcher who is a recent Moodle adopter-describe and discuss the students' and teachers' attitudes to summative and formative computer assessment in Moodle. Item analysis of quiz results helped us to identify and fix poorly performing questions, which greatly reduced student complaints and improved objective assessment. The use of certaintybased marking (CBM) in formative assessment in veterinary pathology was well received by the students and should be extended to more courses. The importance of having proficient computer support personnel should not be underestimated.

Teachers usually implement their pedagogical ideas in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) in a continuous refinement approach also known as “bricolage”. Recently, different proposals have enabled the ubiquitous access to VLEs, thus extending the bricolage mode of operation to other learning spaces. However, such proposals tend to present several limitations for teachers to orchestrate learning situations conducted across different physical and virtual spaces. This paper presents an evaluation study that involved the across-spaces usage of Moodle in bricolage mode and learning buckets (configurable containers of learning artifacts) in multiple learning situations spanning five months in a course on Physical Education in the Natural Environment for pre-service teachers. The study followed a responsive evaluation model, in which we conducted an anticipatory data reduction using an existing orchestration framework (called “5 + 3 aspects”) for structuring data gathering and analysis. The results showed that learning buckets helped the teachers in the multiple aspects of orchestration, overcoming the limitations of alternative approaches in some specific orchestration aspects: helping the involved teachers to connect different physical and physical spaces, while supporting technologies and activities of their everyday practice, and transferring part of the orchestration load from teachers to students. The results also suggested lines of future improvement, including the awareness of outdoor activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

As the advance of learning technologies and analytics tools continues, learning management systems (LMSs) have been required to fulfil the growing expectations for smart learning. However, the reality regarding the level of technology integration in higher education differs considerably from such expectations or the speed of advances in educational technologies. This research aimed to evaluate the current activation levels and usage patterns of a LMS. A large data-set was analysed, which included the online activity information from 7940 courses. Through data pre-processing, general indicators reflecting login frequencies of the virtual campus and activity-based indicators presenting the activation patterns of diverse functions provided by Moodle were derived. Activity theory was applied to interpret the results of analysis, since it has been recognised as a powerful framework to understand phenomena encompassing interactive systems. Further, time-series investigation over three consecutive semesters allowed observation of historical changes. The results revealed considerably low use of the virtual campus with only slight changes, as well as significantly different activity patterns across course attributes and colleges. Contradictions among components in the activity system are discussed, along with the implications for improving teaching and learning with LMS in higher education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This mixed-method study focuses on online learning analytics, a research area of importance. Several important student attributes and their online activities are examined to identify what seems to work best to predict higher grades. The purpose is to explore the relationships between student grade and key learning engagement factors using a large sample from an online undergraduate business course at an accredited American university (n = 228). Recent studies have discounted the ability to predict student learning outcomes from big data analytics but a few significant indicators have been found by some researchers. Current studies tend to use quantitative factors in learning analytics to forecast outcomes. This study extends that work by testing the common quantitative predictors of learning outcome, but qualitative data is also examined to triangulate the evidence. Pre and post testing of information technology understanding is done at the beginning of the course. First quantitative data is collected, and depending on the hypothesis test results, qualitative data is collected and analyzed with text analytics to uncover patterns. Moodle engagement analytics indicators are tested as predictors in the model. Data is also taken from the Moodle system logs. Qualitative data is collected from student reflection essays. The result was a significant General Linear Model with four online interaction predictors that captured 77.5 % of grade variance in an undergraduate business course. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The research examines further education (FE) students’ engagement with virtual learning environments (VLEs) and, in particular, the barriers that may affect the students’ access and use of Moodle. To date, existing research related to VLEs has been conducted primarily within higher education (HE) contexts. In contrast, this study explores the views of both students and teachers in an FE college in England and aims to provide insights into the factors which impact FE learners’ participation in online learning through a VLE. The outcomes of this study indicate that the course design, which is understood as a process, had the most significant effect on the students’ engagement with the VLE, and specifically: (1) its pedagogical focus, (2) the VLE programmes’ accessibility characteristics, and (3) the consideration for students’ individual needs, circumstances and expectations. To address the identified issues, recommendations are provided for teacher training and a strategic approach towards the VLE use. The findings and the associated suggestions may be of value to a wide FE context. © 2017 Association for Research in Post-Compulsory Education (ARPCE).

The aims of this study were to improve progress note documentation by dental students, achieve accurate and timely charge capture and treatment code and note approval, and determine the effectiveness of multiple interventions in improving overall documentation of patient encounters in the clinic of one U.S. dental school. The study, conducted in 2014-15, used a logic model to create a process to address documentation issues in the clinic's electronic dental record (EDR) and to assess the effectiveness of interventions. An initial documentation review using the EDR was performed to obtain a baseline measurement. A significant correlation was noted at baseline between poor documentation and unapproved treatment codes and notes. Unapproved treatment codes and corresponding documentation were then reviewed each month. Students who had the highest number of unapproved treatment codes were identified as potentially having documentation issues. These students were contacted and met individually with the associate quality and compliance officer to review documentation and charge practices. Large group education was also provided to key learners: dental students and supervising faculty members. Education consisted of an inservice event for faculty members and a Moodle site course on documentation for students. After one year, the results showed that documentation rates improved from an overall rate of 61% to 81% of required documentation elements being present in the progress note. Although this educational intervention was successful in significantly improving documentation of treatment in the EDR, 19% of the notes at the conclusion of the study were still missing key elements. Further research is necessary to determine whether the interventions will continue to improve documentation or if additional measures need to be taken. © 2017 American Dental Education Association.

Purpose: This study was conducted to suggest the development of a learning management system for dental radiology education using the Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle). Materials and Methods: Moodle is a well-known and verified open-source software-learning management system (OSS-LMS). The Moodle software was installed on a server computer and customized for dental radiology education. The system was implemented for teaching undergraduate students to diagnose dental caries in panoramic images. Questions were chosen that could assess students' diagnosis ability. Students were given several questions corresponding to each of 100 panoramic images. Results: The installation and customization of Moodle was feasible, cost-effective, and time-saving. By having students answer questions repeatedly, it was possible to train them to examine panoramic images sequentially and thoroughly. Conclusion: Based on its educational efficiency and efficacy, the adaptation of an OSS-LMS in dental school may be highly recommended. The system could be extended to continuing education for dentists. Further studies on the objective evaluation of knowledge acquisition and retention are needed. © 2017.

Higher education institutions are faced with the complex challenges of serving increased enrollment levels within tight budgets. This challenge is prompting many universities to explore new approaches including the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle for delivering courses to help extend teaching and learning beyond the classroom. Using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as an underlying theory, this study investigated students' perceived usefulness as well as the perceived ease of use of Moodle in the University of Education, Winneba in Ghana. The study also used multiple linear regression to determine if these factors have any impact on the rate at which students use Moodle. Data was collected from a random sample of 229 students from the Faculty of Science Education using a questionnaire. The analysis revealed that students' perceived usefulness of Moodle and perceived challenges in using Moodle combined contributes significantly to students' rate of Moodle use.

Nowadays, the use of facial authentication software in distance education could help to guarantee the proper login of students in the Learning Management Systems. Also, facial software utilization in online activities will probably identify students and prevent cheating. Thus, the current research analyzes the suitability of introducing a facial authentication software application in different LMS tools. In order to reach this goal, the perceptions of 67 master students were analyzed. Students were divided into two groups. The facial software was applied to the first group at the same time when this group did their coursework using Tests, Glossaries, and Lessons Moodle tools. The second group did their course work using Forums, Task mailboxes, and Databases Moodle tools without the surveillance of the facial software. Then, both groups were surveyed by a questionnaire related to the students' perception about using facial authentication software in Moodle tools. The data analysis revealed that the Moodle tools in which the implantation of facial authentication software would be important are Tests, Glossaries and Lessons. © 2017 Tempus Publications.

A Moodle-based podcast teaching platform is designed for the course of aerobic gymnastics. Although abundant teaching tools and resources are available on the Moodle teaching platform, it doesn't support playing video and audio. Thus, podcast module is added. Podcast, as an innovative medium form, is convenient for playing video and audio. The key to learning aerobic gymnastics is to master the essentials of movements. We adopted the patented technology of a method and device of real-time animation generation in video in teaching, to help learners comprehend movements of aerobic gymnastics and raise learning efficiency. We also performed contrast experiment to check the effect of the teaching platform in teaching practice. The results show that the experimental group performed better than the control group in respect of both routine and movement, and demonstration capability. The platform is largely helpful for learners to comprehend the movements and raise learning efficiency. Thus, these findings indicate the Moodle-based podcast teaching platform has a good application prospect in physical education.

Currently e-learning has become an integral part of university education. It is also an integral part of distant education, which is now rapidly developing. One of the most effective patterns of modern higher education is blended learning that combines traditional classroom activities with elements of distance training, and makes a wide use of modern information technology. The study covers the authors' experience in the implementation of blended learning in teaching physics through LMS Moodle to undergraduates who follow the Professional Education program "Energetics". It focuses on the structure of the distant education modules developed by the authors as well as on the methods of their use. While analyzing the results, the authors came to the conclusion about educational expediency of blended learning modules in the framework of undergraduate programs. © 2017. revistaESPACIOS.com.

English has become increasingly important for medical professionals in Japan. This means English language teachers in medical schools are tasked to not only deliver an intensive time constrained English curriculum, but also expected to design and implement effective and attractive review courses for learners' autonomous study. The authors of this paper have created Moodle-based English courses to improve the English curricula by integrating 'blended-learning' in class. They also have started to provide ongoing access to a range of review courses to help their students' autonomous study. This paper outlines how the authors integrated a self-reflective framework and a badge system in the review courses they created. It illustrates how this framework helped learners identify for themselves the appropriate course at the appropriate level. It also demonstrates how the awarding of badges helps to motivate learners to actively engage with and complete the module and/or the course they have chosen.

The learning process, among its different phases, involves monitoring of users behaviour in order to extract knowledge. Details about users have significant weight to understand the interests and intentions and produce forward-looking statements, as well as keep track of the learning management system (LMS). In this work, a model to investigate and predict the behavior of users, taken to explore the additional knowledge information and predict the learning outcomes, is described. In the first instance, the information are extracted through a suitable tool, and, subsequently, are submitted to an analysis phase. Time series analysis techniques are adopted to detect partial similarities between the navigation data and, subsequently, to extract a classification. Finally, performance are measured through statistical measures to evaluate the goodness of proposed approach and test its significance. The results, obtained on Moodle platform, show that the proposed model leads to accurate outcome prediction about users behavior and can be adopted to improve the learning paths, both in its implementation and design. © 2017, Italian e-Learning Association.

Collaborative project-based learning is well established as a component of several courses in higher education, since it seems to motivate students and make them active in the learning process. Collaborative Project-Based Learning methods are demanded so that tutors become able to intervene and guide the students in flexible ways: by encouraging them to develop independent solutions and also by keeping their efforts and activities targeted towards the lesson goals. Students, on the other hand, need to develop important skills in searching and analyzing information as well as in communication and time management. In this paper, we propose the design of a collaboration script, following the "Group Investigation method", to support the tutors and students of a collaborative project-based course on 'DataBases'. We implemented this script using a compound e-learning collaborative environment based on MOODLE and LAMS, which have provided tutors with several tools and methods to involve in the learning process. The evaluation of the students' projects and the comparison with the corresponding projects of the previous academic year showed a better level of collaboration and performance of the students but also proved that the learning environment offered the tutors a more efficient way to guide their students in Collaborative Project-Based Learning.

New tools for teaching with distance education afford students with a variety of modes of communication. This study examined students' interactions during an online science education course. All interactions that took place with Elluminate Chat, Elluminate Voice, and Moodle learning platforms were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Interactions were coded according to the target of the interaction, the content, and the type of interaction (comment or question). Results showed that the different modes of interaction provided distinctly different opportunities for communication and served different purposes with the instruction. Furthermore, there were individual differences in students' behaviors across the communication modes. The implications of the study for synchronous and asynchronous distance education of teachers are discussed. © 2017.

The focus of this paper is the evaluation of an online course designed and developed within the context of blended learning for the Department of Communication and Media of the University of Athens. The course was based on the principles of distance learning; it utilised the opensource learning management system - Moodle, and it was implemented as an action research project for three consecutive semesters (2014-2016). Its pedagogical aim was to investigate a prototype model of digital learning: the 'interactive evaluation' that was embodied in the design of the e-course and in the cycles of action research. Acting as creators, teachers and researchers in order to investigate the student-evaluators' perceptions of the e-course, we attempted to 'produce' wider knowledge of the assessment criteria within the context of blended education. In particular, the how and why specific learning criteria and critical approach to knowledge can be organised as more general constructivist and student-centred indexes of the learning technology. As a case study, the research outcomes revealed factors related to expression of interest, encouragement for participation and motivation of students to infiltrate, evaluate the e-course and contribute to remodelling its educational material.

This paper aims to investigate the extent to which the use of a virtual patient (VP) improves the level of theoretical knowledge and confidence (self-efficacy) of psychology and medicine students to perform clinical diagnostics. We created two classes on an e-learning Moodle platform, presenting as a virtual patient the evaluation of the same panic disorder case. One class used a linear VP, the other, a branched VP (a decision-tree type). The sample consisted of 159 volunteer participants, a mix of psychology and medicine students, randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, linear virtual patient (PVL) and branched virtual patient (PAD). Before and after the training with the virtual patient sequence, a questionnaire investigated the theoretical knowledge and the self-efficacy levels. For self-efficacy evaluation, we used the Session Management sub-scale of Counsellor Activity Self-Efficacy Scales, by Robert W. and Clara E. Hill. Both types of VPs are associated with a statistically significant increase of knowledge about panic disorder diagnostic criteria, reinforcing the fact that the virtual patient has an impact on the cognitive profile (declarative knowledge) and on self-efficacy (related to procedural knowledge). Still, the study does not prove that one of the two types of virtual patient have a significant better outcome.

One of the great challenges in distance-learning is to follow the actions of the teachers/tutors and also the actions of students during the process of teaching and learning. This article presents the FAG Tool integrated with the LMS Moodle was developed to help managers of the Distance Education environment to monitor the actions of teachers/tutors and also teachers/tutors in the follow-up of student actions. Through the techniques of Business Intelligence (BI) and Learning Analytics (LA), the tool generates analytical reports and dashboards, presenting a holistic and transversal view, being this vision the differential of this tool. The use of FAG allows teachers/tutors to monitor the participation of all their students in all virtual rooms under their responsibility and thus take corrective measures in the teaching and learning process, such as reducing the risk of avoidance. For the managers, it can be considered as a support tool for decision making regarding the faculty, maintaining or not the teacher/tutor in the process of teaching and learning or even be a base to enlarge or reduce their classes depending on their performance in the virtual environment. Through the use of the FAG, this decision-making can happen during the teaching and learning process and not only after the end, as is usual, because the reports are easy to understand and present accurate information in time to ensure the success of the teaching and learning process. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

The new challenges in international engineering education needs to go further from traditional technical skills acquisitions, allowing future engineers to easily work within international teams. To do that, the acquisition of sociocultural elements becomes an essential skill for these future engineers. Traditionally, this acquisition has been done through popular European programs such as ERASMUS programme. However, the current European context sometimes makes it difficult for students developing this kind of physical mobility. For this reason, the Virtual Mobility (VM) concept has emerged as an alternative to support the education activities, which can facilitate international experiences of collaboration and sociocultural exchanges among students. This paper presents the main results generated from UbiCamp project based on VM. The paper presents both, the formal definition of a software framework that allows to integrate traditional e-learning tools (as Moodle), with non-traditional sociocultural tools (as Virtual Worlds), and a complete Virtual World, designed and integrated in the UbiCamp framework, to provide a 3D highly immersive environment to stimulate the sociocultural immersion among students. Finally, some empirical results extracted from 60 students and 28 teachers who were involved in this VM experience, are analyzed to show the potential of VM as a tool for international mobility education. © 2017 TEMPUS Publications.

Blended learning is increasingly gaining importance in all levels of educational system, particularly in tertiary education. In engineering profiles the core blended learning activity is students' independent work, the efficiency of which is defined by the degree of students' active involvement into the educational process, their ability to absorb new knowledge independently, on their own. Our research is aimed at the analysis of blended learning and at revealing the approaches meant to activate students' independent work in blended learning based on LMS Moodle platform. The characteristic feature of the suggested approach is the orientation towards skills and work methods mastering carried out in the form of professional competencies training at practical classes and laboratory workshops. For the purpose of our research we used one of the most interactive Moodle tools - "workshop" in order to fulfill informational, educational and monitoring functions of learning. The use of the tool allowed revealing drawbacks of the method under study and managing these drawbacks in the most effective way. The paper contains the description of students' learning and independent work which would stimulate students' activity, self-management and develop their communicative skills. The outcomes of the current research proved that the approaches suggested significantly stir students' interest, thus, enhancing students their learning motivation, development of critical thinking and self-reflection, which altogether facilitate understanding theoretical material, encourage the development of practical skills and promote the pursue of academic goals. © 2017 by Academic Publishing.

With the adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions, a lot of data has become available describing students' online behavior. Many researchers have used these data to predict student performance. This has led to a rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms underlying student performance. We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies. We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions. Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses. Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low. In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value. We outline the implications of our findings and emphasize the need to include more specific theoretical argumentation and additional data sources other than just the LMS data. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

This study constructs a flipped classroom model based on modern educational technology, in which 90 students majored in Chinese language and literature in University were chosen to participate in the study. The effects are evaluated based on a questionnaire survey. Conclusions are: The flipped classroom model is feasible and effective, and it can effectively improve students' learning interest, self-directed learning competence, collaborative learning competence and practical capacity. Moodle can provide a good platform for flipped classroom. Not all instructional contents are fit to be flipped, so we should choose the suitable contents for flipping.

Purpose: In higher education, a combination of traditional face-to-face learning and e-learning is becoming very popular. During their studies, students are enroled in several e-courses. They perceive various aspects of e-courses and show different responses when using teaching materials and learning in an e-course. The purpose of this paper is to measure such aspects from the students’ perspective and explore the differences among various subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: In the survey, students expressed their opinions on 13 different aspects (a seven-level scale) of the e-courses in which they were enroled. In addition, the influence of some demographic characteristics was analysed. The authors used statistical tests (t-test and ANOVA) to compare the means among the analysed subgroups. Findings: The empirical results reveal some differences among the subgroups of students. Students’ attitudes to blended learning increase significantly by year of study and decrease according to the amount of other non-study activities. Simplicity of finding materials in an e-course is the factor where male and female students differ significantly. This finding serves as a guideline for faculty management concerned with how to adjust blended learning to fulfil the various expectations of different student subgroups. Originality/value: This paper’s insights will be of value to individuals and institutions engaged in the e-learning process in higher education. In particular, the results will be helpful to the faculty management and teachers with the main task to increase the engagement of particular groups of students regarding the work in e-courses. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

To establish a more comparable, compatible, and coherent system of higher education in Europe, the so-called Bologna Process (BP) has been adopted. As a measure to improve comparability, the BP requires that every study path, module, or course has to define a Learning Goal (LG) which is specified by the conveyed competences. Until now, the expectations towards the BP regarding comparability have not been fulfilled because competences are usually described in form of free text and not in standardized terms. The fact that since adoption of the BP more than 10.000 study programs have been created in Germany outlines a trend which demonstrates the need of improved solutions. Regarding comparability, so-called Competence Frameworks (CFs) with standardized, machine-readable competences are promising tools; therefore, they should be integrated into progressive software infrastructures concerned with creation, management, and execution of study paths, modules and courses. For this purpose, the so-called Qualifications Based Learning Model (QBLM) has been developed. In this paper, we introduce a general system architecture which is designed for realizing Competence-based Learning IT-infrastructures. Furthermore, the conceptual design and prototypical implementation of a Course Authoring Tool (CAT) is described which is based on the QBLM and the information-, content-, knowledge-, and learning management platform Knowledge Management Ecosystem Portal (KM-EP). The integration of the QBLM into Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle which is an underlying subsystem of the KM-EP platform is work in progress.

The past decade has seen the rapid adoption and use of various Learning Management Systems (LMS) in Africa, and Tanzania in particular. Institutions have been spending thousands of dollars to implement these systems in a bid to improve the quality of education as well as increasing students' enrolments through distance and blended learning. However, the impact of these system on improving students' performance has been a popular subject of research in recent years. Studies have been relying on data from users' opinions and subjective interpretation through surveys to determine the effectiveness of LMS usage on students' learning performance. The use of such data is normally subject to the possibility of distortion or low reliability. Therefore, this study designed and developed Learning Analytics tool and used the tool to determine the causation between LMS usage and students' performance. Data from LMS log of two courses delivered at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) were extracted using developed Learning Analytics tool and subjected into linear regression analysis with students' final results. The study found that discussion posts, peer interaction, and exercises were determined to be significant factors for students' academic achievement in blended learning at MUST. Nonetheless, time spend in the LMS, number of downloads, and login frequency were found to have no significant impact on students' learning performance. The implications of these results on improving students' learning are discussed.

A project for the creation and implementation of a distancelearning course on Indoor Environmental Comfort in Buildings (IECB) is presented. This course resulted from a request by Ordem dos Engenheiros (Portuguese engineering professional body) to the University of Coimbra. It was based on the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) course of the Master in Energy for Sustainability and PhD in Sustainable Energy Systems of the University of Coimbra, coordinated by the first author. Jointly with the support of the Distance Education Service of the University of Coimbra, using as a starting point the existing contents of a formal discipline, the teaching methodologies and a set of activities were developed to implement a distance-learning course with a strong e-learning component by the students. Diversified strategies, using the existing platform running on Moodle, such as webinars, virtual laboratories, remote access labs, discussion forums and synchronous sessions, were tested to ensure a dynamic and interested engagement of the students along the course.

Reflectivity is an important professional competence of contemporary teachers. In order to explore how to encourage students’ reflection, we conducted a two-year action research project impelling them to become mutual critical friends. For critical friendship communication and other project activities, we utilised Moodle-an online learning management system. On the basis of the analysed data that were gathered at the end of each action research cycle, we determined that the students felt comfortable in the role of critical friends and that critical friends’ reflections were particularly pleasant for them. They experienced the comments of their critical friends as friendly, encouraging, useful, specific, interesting, detailed, positive, professional and clear. The majority of students (91%) think that the critical friendship discussion should be continued within the course Correlated-integrated systems in Croatian language teaching, and 85% of them suggest introducing this approach in other teachers’ education courses. We determined that the technical mode of reflective thinking prevails in the students’ correspondence. The practical or contextual level could rarely be observed while critical reflection was completely absent in 11 of 14 discussions. Reflective thinking of students (future teachers) should be fostered from the beginning of their studies within various courses, particularly in the pedagogical and methodological ones. To encourage their students to be critically reflective, university teachers should embrace reflective thinking by becoming critically-reflective practitioners and conducting action research in their teaching practices. © 2017, University of Ljubljana.

The purpose of this quasi-experimental research was to assess the performance of nursing students on a knowledge test before and after their participation in a distance learning unit on topical therapy for chronic wounds using a virtual learning environment (VLE Moodle). The study was conducted in three stages: application of a pretest, implementation of the intervention in the VLE Moodle, and application of a post-test. The participants were 37 students from the last year of a nursing undergraduate course in a public higher education institution in the state of São Paulo. There was a statistically significant increase in the mean number of correct answers obtained on the knowledge test after the intervention in all fields and items assessed in the test. The use of the VLE Moodle may represent a supporting strategy to strengthen and broaden the access of nursing undergraduates to knowledge on relevant topics for nursing care. © Servicio de Publicaciones-Universidad de Murcia.

Online learning represents the current form of distance education. However, it is a new trend for Arab nations and Iraq in particular. Moreover, previous literature has shown that not all learners are satisfied in this learning mode. The present study then aims to identify the predictors of learner satisfaction in online education. It proposes a Conceptual Model of Learner Satisfaction (CMLS) based on the findings of prior studies. A total of 70 learners voluntarily filled out a research survey at the end of an online course. Based on the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis, performance expectancy and course quality were significant predictors of learner satisfaction whereas system quality failed to identify a significant influence on this construct. Other factors integrated into the proposed framework showed an indirect effect on learner satisfaction. Overall, the proposed model explained 52.5% of the variance of this variable indicating a good fit. The implications of this study are discussed for further research. © Medwell Journals, 2017.

The Locus of Control is a specific mode that allows each individual to identify the causes that determine a given event and therefore their own successes and failures. The internal attribution style is based on the subject’s ability, commitment, and intelligence. It strengthens self-esteem and sense of personal self-efficacy and is crucial to fostering school success. This research shows that an attributive-metacognitive training can improve the attributional style of students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Such training offers the students the opportunity to reflect on their skills and strategies by expanding motivation through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This perspective and longitudinal study, measured the attribution style of attendees (30 subjects attending the first grade of secondary school in northeast Italy) before and after a metacognitive and attributive program. The training, carried out on-line and in attendance, lasted FOR about 8 months (from April 2015 to November 2015). The article presents the positive outcomes of the training, obtained by comparing the data emerging from the Attribution Questionnaire and regularized and standardized values (De Beni & Moè, 1995). The study extends knowledge on approaches and programs aimed at improving the attributional style in children with SEN. A progress of the internal attributional style is conducive to improving academic success in these subjects. © 2017, Italian e-Learning Association. All rights reserved.

The availability of educational resources on the Web is an efficient way of acquiring and sharing the knowledge through e-Learning. Nowadays there are hundreds of learning objects on the Internet; these objects are developed under e-Learning specifications and standards, such as SCORM and IMS Content Package. These standards allow the use of learning objects in learning management systems. However, learning environments and learning objects must have been built to the same standards. In this sense, there are several initiatives for e-Learning supported by services oriented architectures and Web services technologies. These initiatives pursue the integration of features that promote interoperability and thereby reusability of educational resources. The goal of this paper is to describe how educational resources can be dealt with as Web services in a learning management system, representing an alternative to learning objects. In this sense, learning Web services are software components that allow the use of educational resources. The employment of learning Web services allows the use and reuse of educational content in different learning environments, and other client applications. These learning Web services can be described, published, discovered and invoked using open standards over an Internet protocol backbone, such as SOAP, XML, WSDL, and HTTP. This can be achieved by extending a Learning Management Systems like Moodle, where integration, presentation, and management of learning Web services may be performed, as described in this paper. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

In the constructivist approach, various self-assessment techniques are being developed to enable students to assess themselves in the learning process. The purpose of the study is to investigate relation between students' preferences in assessment process and students' performances. The study was conducted with 67 sophomore students enrolled in Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies at a State University. The study was carried out in "Measurement and Evaluation in Education" course. At the beginning, Moodle LMS was used to define the preferences of students about their own assessment criteria (discussion, quiz, assignment and viewing of course content). Throughout the process, students were received the course instructional package in the classroom. Then they were asked to fill the assessment activities on the LMS. Students' actual performances in online activities in terms of their preference about assessment criteria was calculated as students course achievement scores. The mean value of the scores and the standard deviation were guided us to divide the participants into three groups (unsuccessful, moderately successful, successful) considering their means and standard deviations. Then, the preferences of students and their academic achievements were associated in each group. As a result, various criteria were come to front in both successful and unsuccessful groups. Surprisingly, none of the students preferred viewing course content and participating in discussions as the highest assessment criterion. Besides, it was found that all the students in successful group preferred viewing course content as lowest assessment criterion. The results indicated that, there were no prominent criteria in the relations between the preferences of students about assessment process and the academic performances. However, most of the students in unsuccessful group performed better in assignment although they did not preferred the assignment as the highest assessment criterion. At the end of the study, we noticed that while considering the criterion in the assessment process, taking students' perspectives and preferences into consideration motivated students positively and had somehow related to their academic achievements. Thus, it is hoped that the study can provides an insight to future studies to enrich assessment activities with giving responsibilities to students in learning, especially in assessment process.

Practical works have a fundamental role in the curriculum of any scientist, engineer, and technician. It helps learners to face the real world and put in practice what they have learned to judge their operability. Moreover, due to some limiting factors and due to the growth number of learners, universities and institutes have become inapt to give efficient learning. Distance education presents a future key to reduce these restrictions. Currently, remote experiments together with web-based courses approach significantly contribute to many aspects of education for learners. In this context, the main question addressed is how we ensure that an educational system evolves to better serve the needs of learners? The present work proposes a solution based on student's Personal Learning Environments. Personal Learning Environments are educational platforms that help learners take control and manage their own learning process, learning modules with remote experiments, for reaching a specific goal. In order to response these criteria we use the Learning Management System Moodle, the e-portfolio Mahara, the Remote Laboratory Management System iLab Shared Architecture with additional tools and plug-ins to implement the learning by doing environment.

Objective: To develop and evaluate an online course on Basic Life Support. Method: Technological production research of online course guided by the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) instructional design model based on Andragogy and the Meaningful Learning Theory. The online course was constructed in the platform Moodle, previously assessed by a group of experts, and then presented to the students of the Nursing School of the University of São Paulo, who assessed it at the end of the course. Results: The course was evaluated by the experts and obtained a mean score of 0.92 (SD 0.15), considered as good quality (between 0.90-0.94), and by the students, with a mean score of 0.95 (SD 0.03), considered as high quality (0.95-1.00). Conclusion: The instructional design used was found to be appropriate to the development of the online course. As an active educational strategy, it contributed to the learning on Basic Life Support during cardiac arrest-related procedures in adults. In view of the need for technological innovations in education and systematization of care in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the online course allows the establishment of continuous improvement processes in the quality of resuscitation in the care provided by students and professionals. © 2017 Escola de Enfermagem de Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Technological tools have permeated higher education programs. However, their mere introduction does not guarantee instructional quality. This article presents the results of an innovation project aimed at fostering autonomous learning among students at a Pre-School and Primary Teacher degree. For one semester all freshmen students used a system for autonomous learning embedded in the institutional online platform (Moodle), which included automatic formative feedback. The system was part of a complex formative assessment program. We present results of the experience concerning two aspects: the students' actual use of the system, and their final appraisal of it. The quantitative descriptive analysis focuses on the students' perspective to evaluate the adequacy of the instructional decisions. Results indicate that students need certain limits to be able to manage their learning better if we pursue the quality of innovation. These limits refer mainly to the time of accessibility and the limitation of attempts of practice. With respect to time, an appropriate span of time (neither too long nor too short) must be chosen; with respect to the number of attempts, it is expedient to limit rather than promote free endless access.

E-learning is becoming more and more important in contemporary education. It allows learners to learn at their own pace, when their schedule permits it. However, learners have individual needs and different traits such as learning styles, knowledge levels, motivation and cognitive abilities. Therefore, a need for personalized learning has been made clear. Two ways of personalized learning are discussed in this paper: the first is Protus 2.1. - a tutoring system that allows personalization based on learning styles and collaborative tagging and the second one is PLeMSys - a model of a Moodle plug-in where personalization is based on learning styles and knowledge level.

Research presented in this paper represents a further step towards proving the efficiency of gamification in higher education. Our research was conducted within two higher education institutions and includes full-time and part-time students who enrolled in the courses 3D modeling and Programming. Based on the research results, three hypotheses were tested. These hypotheses give a better insight into some psychological phenomes. The first hypotheses tested the level of knowledge in experimental and control groups for all students who achieved a minimum of 50% score in the pre-test. Our results confirmed the existence of statistically significant difference in the benefit of the experimental group. The other two hypotheses are spreading results even more. We analyzed 50% of the highest ranked and also 50% of the lowest ranked students' score with the use of t-test. Based on our analysis of the average number of points on the post-test for participants with the lowest ranking we found no statistically significant difference. On the other hand, the same analysis for participants with the highest ranking shows, with statistically significant difference, that the experimental group achieved notably better score. © 2017 Andrija Bernik, Danijel Radoševic and Daniel Strmecki.

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) employ Learning Management Systems (LMSs) primarily for greater efficiency, profitability, technological advancement or survival. The predominantly used LMSs, Moodle and Blackboard account for in excess of 60% usage by the top HEIs. However, the individual international regions do not necessarily bear the percentages of the overall total. Gaps are identified in optimality in course delivery within online learning when one studies LMSs and their functionalities. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative which was established to standardize and modernize training and education management and delivery, developed and recommended usage of Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 and later versions. SCORM 2004 which provides for flexibility in sequencing and navigation for learner-centric course delivery is not supported in any version of the more prevalently used LMSs. It is believed that most people have a preferred way in processing information. We propose codifying one or more Learning Style Instruments (LSIs), diagnosing the preferred teaching approach(es) and dominant/existing learning styles within a batch of learners, then providing course delivery as a best-fit per learner. As a proof of concept, OLeCenT allows the input of one or more course learning paths with real-time learning and automatic reconfiguration of the course path where a new trend or pattern is identified. OLeCenT identified disparity in teaching-learning and provided a mechanism towards improving online learner-centric course delivery. OLeCenT also identified comparative levels of similarities among learners and instructors even where they are deemed to be of different teaching-learning styles/mechanisms. © 2017 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.

The importance of the role of peer and self-assessment in developing formative and sustainable assessment practice in higher education is increasingly becoming evident. PeerWise is an online software tool that engages students in contributing to their own and others' learning by authoring, answering and providing feedback on multiple choice questions. Using a mixed methods approach, 20 students responded to discussion questions and an online survey about their perceptions of using PeerWise compared to online quizzes as part of the blended delivery of a postgraduate psychology unit. Students considered both authoring and answering questions in PeerWise to equally benefit their learning. Answering questions in PeerWise was perceived to be more helpful for learning than questions on a Moodle quiz. This advantage was evident across more complex cognitive skills, understanding, applying, evaluating and creating information, although only significant for facilitating understanding. PeerWise and online quizzes were seen to be equally helpful in facilitating recall. Despite the perceived benefits of PeerWise, students preferred quiz questions to be set by an expert if used as recognition of progress. Introducing PeerWise was effective in promoting engagement with peers; however, refinements to the model should focus on increasing student confidence in their own and peers' capabilities. © 2017, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology.

In this paper, the current state of contemporary virtual space from the position of the presence of opportunities to offer to use when learning Russian as a foreign language by foreign children and children of migrants, whose age ranges are from three to 14 years, as well as the assistive tools in teaching this age group the Russian language are given. The rapidly growing volume of tools and applications brings the problem of the availability of technologies to the fore.1 That is why virtual educational environment is already an integral element of teaching children and adults of all ages in the modern world. In terms of the ubiquitous information society the education sector is forced to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of the society, and therefore an inclusion of information and communication technologies and other supportive structures, such as the Internet, various educational platforms like Moodle, into the learning process at all stages is mandatory to achieve successful result of preschool, school and other training for children. In this study, carried out in the framework of the project entitled "Competition courses open education in Russian language", implemented under the Federal target program "Russian language 2016- 2020", we have studied the Internet in search of online resources that help children of different age groups in the study of Russian as a foreign language. An approximately equal ratio of the resources for the childrennative speakers of the Russian language and resources, suggesting studying Russian as a foreign language was identified. Also the analysis of the identified resources and the classification according to various criteria with an aim of their classification was carried out. As a result of this research, we came to the conclusion that in modern virtual space there are resources that can be used as auxiliary facilities for studying Russian as a foreign language by children, speakers of different languages. However, we believe that the role of the teacher (tutor, mentor) remains extremely important.

Task-based language learning (TBLL) has heavily influenced syllabus design, classroom teaching, and learner assessment in a foreign or second language teaching context. In this English as foreign language (EFL) learning environment, the paper discussed an innovative language learning pedagogy based on design education and technical writing. In this TBLL course, the language learning based assignments centered on designing and analyzing objects using various computer-aided design software and physical LEGO toolkit. The design software was used collaboratively and the design analysis was done mostly as group activities. The language production activities centered on technical document authoring, using collaborative online authoring tools for website hosting and note-taking for design projects, besides oral in-class presentations, and online posting in English. Language reception activities such as readings related to the course lectures, videos, assignment, and assessment instructions were hosted and linked from Moodle—the learning management system. This paper critically analyzed student performance with physical LEGO design and CAD software, including how student groups authored websites detailing the structural and functional specifications related to the product assembly procedure. This paper outlined how design pedagogy could be included in the curriculum while teaching English as a foreign language. In the process, students not only learnt about design fundamentals, but how to author complex technical documents in English. Findings based on course data and class interactions have adequately demonstrated that students were capable of handling the task-based language projects with reasonable efficiency and confidence. © 2017 The Author(s).

This work is the result of research that proposes the incorporation of Distance Learning into a Business Game as a strategy to enhance tutor training, considering entrepreneurship difficulties faced by public school teachers. Part of the problem could be attributed to subject type, because, in general, it is not common to find entrepreneurship on school curricula. The Distance Learning (DL) activities were developed using the Moodle platform and structured by topic to increase educational flexibility and achieve a better balance between individual reflection and online discussion. It was developed in four steps: course content development; course evaluation by computer technicians; restructuring the course based on course evaluation done by computer technicians and course evaluation by teachers from the public school system. A preliminary test was performed with informatics technicians to technically evaluate the learning environment. Based on this, the course was restructured, applying corrections and adjustments to improve environment usability. After corrections, a final test was conducted with public school system teachers to analyze user perception, which gave a positive result. Virtual learning environment evaluation is complex and multidisciplinary, requiring the technical knowledge of internet programming and a conceptual knowledge of education, especially in the field of learning. When the evaluation done by teachers was examined, it was found that deficiencies pointed out by computer technicians had been resolved, giving a positive rating. This current research concludes that DL can improve the use of games, because it is possible to structure the content related to the learning gaps of specific groups of students. In this respect the use of games results can guide the development of content. © 2018 Production.

Ubiquitous learning and integrated online assessment have been provided by the e-learning system in the majority higher education institutions. This study is aimed to explore students’ perceptions and views on online assessment in the e-learning system, Moodle and examine the extent of utilize online assessment in Moodle at higher education institution. A total of one hundred fourteen students from the School of Computing and Information Technology at Taylor’s University Malaysia participated in this survey study. The instrument was the modified questionnaire designed to determine students’ perceptions on online learning, based on six dimensions: affective factors, validity, reliability, security, practicality and pedagogy. The overall results and findings have revealed that the online assessment in Moodle is valid, secure, practical and do not cause affective factors to the students. The majority of the students had perceived positive to the pedagogy of online assessment. However, security and technical issues need to be solved in future to provide an effective online assessment to students. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

The widespread popularity of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) and Internet have allowed the convergence of e-Learning into daily practices of the higher education institutions. Since Moodle is an Internetbased platform, the chance of expose to the security threats and vulnerabilities of Internet also arise. The objectives of this study was to explore students’ experience with Moodle and their perceptions on the security of Moodle as well as their awareness to security issues of Moodle. This exploratory study involved 61 foundation and undergraduate students from Taylor’s University Malaysia. The research design has been proposed and explained in this study. The overall results and findings have revealed that the majority students have positive experience with Taylor’s Integrated Moodle e-Learning System (TIMeS). Information, content and assessment tools that provided in TIMeS are helpful from the students’ experience. The results also shown that most of the students give positive responds on the security of TIMeS and their awareness of security issues of TIMeS are positive. However, there is some issues need to be solved by educate students about the security of e-learning system, such as scan device storage, changing password frequently and other extra security components for e-learning system. Findings of this study can be used to cater meaningful insights for establishing more efficient and secure e-learning system to the users. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

Nurses working in oncology require continuing education and nowadays distance education is a possibility. To compare learning outcomes of the professionals participating in classroom learning versus distance learning; describing the sociodemographic characteristics and digital fluency of participants; comparing learning outcomes with independent variables; assessing the adequacy of educational practices in Virtual Environment Moodle Learning through the constructivist online learning environment survey. An experimental, randomized controlled study; conducted at the A C Camargo Cancer Center, located in São Paulo, SP, Brazil. The study included 97 nurses, with average training of 1 to 2 years. A control group (n = 44) had face to face training and the experiment group (n = 53) had training by distance learning, both with identical program content. The dependent variable was the result of learning, measured by applying a pre-assessment questionnaire and post-intervention for both groups. The sociodemographic and digital fluency data were uniform among the groups. The performance of both groups was statistically significant (p 0.005), and the control group had a greater advantage (40.4 %). Distance education has proven to be an effective alternative for training nurses, especially when they have more complex knowledge, more experience in the area and institutional time. Distance Education may be a possibility for the training of nurses for work in oncology. The association of age, training time and the institution, and the experience in Oncology interfered in the performance of both groups. © 2015, American Association for Cancer Education.

Higher education has been pressured to shift towards more flexible, effective, active, and student-centered teaching strategies that mitigate the limitations of traditional transmittal models of education. Lately, the flipped classroom model has been suggested to support this transition. However, research on the use of flipped classroom in higher education is in its infancy and little is known about student’s perceptions of learning through flipped classroom. This study examined students’ perceptions of flipped classroom education in a last year university course in research methods. A questionnaire was administered measuring students’ (n = 240) perceptions of flipped classroom in general, video as a learning tool, and Moodle (Learning Management System) as a supporting tool within the frame of a flipped classroom model. The results revealed that a large majority of the students had a positive attitude towards flipped classroom, the use of video and Moodle, and that a positive attitude towards flipped classroom was strongly correlated to perceptions of increased motivation, engagement, increased learning, and effective learning. Low achievers significantly reported more positively as compared to high achievers with regards to attitudes towards the use of video as a learning tool, perceived increased learning, and perceived more effective learning. © 2016, The Author(s).

Nowadays, the Information technologies are more and more widely used in the mathematical education system. The generalization of experience and its implementation by means of the open source software is of current interest. It is also important to address this problem due to the transfer to the new FSES (Federal State Education Standards) of high education. The use of open source software systems allows organizing an effective information environment to support the educational process at the lowest financial costs, including for the distance learning and training of persons with reduced mobility. Within this article we consider the results of mobile e-learning system development based on a Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle and some aspects of its application in the educational process of the Institute of Natural, Mathematical and Technical Sciences of the Lipetsk State Pedagogical University (LGPU). Based on a survey of lecturers and 50 graduates from the areas of “Teacher Education” and “Professional Education” it was found that the average value of the time that the respondents consider as appropriate to devote to the study of subjects by electronic educational resources is 37.5%. Taking into account the data obtained from the study, we substantiate the expediency of applying electronic educational resources as auxiliary tools of students training. The article focuses on the mathematical discipline due to the need to implement the Concept of mathematical education development. © 2016 Dolgikh and Zemtcov.

This article describes the use of Moodle as a suitable platform to support the postgraduate open and distance learning (ODL) courses offered by Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM). Many USIM postgraduate students who take obligatory courses (e.g., research methodology and data analysis) are taught at different venues to facilitate students’ access to higher education and enhance quality of lifelong learning. Managing this complex teaching network has called for the adaptation of Moodle platform. This approach meets two relevant requirements, (a) to ensure consistency, compliance, and quality of teaching, (b) to reduce educational costs, which largely depend on the number of peripheral venues for teaching activities. This article analyses the functionalities of the Moodle platform and its use among USIM postgraduate students and academics. The data was collected based on content analysis via questionnaire applied to 18 USIM ODL postgraduate students and 4 lecturers. The results show that despite having great potential, Moodle is mainly used as a repository for materials. Moreover, lecturers recognize the importance of the use of other functionalities of this platform in order to promote the success of the teaching and learning process. © ACPIL.

Background: Only 14 % of American physicians report that they feel adequately trained to provide nutritional counselling. The average number of nutrition teaching hours in American medical schools is falling below recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and nutritional education in the medical school curriculum is currently an important discussion topic. Aims: This study aimed to review the teaching hours delivered during a 6-year medical programme at The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland-Bahrain (RCSI-B) and define the importance of nutritional education for medical students. Methods: Lecture time regarding the topic of nutrition was quantified by studying the contents of the 6-year course materials on the Moodle® platform virtual learning environment used by RCSI-B. Results: Students are exposed to approximately 15 h of education in nutrition during their medical studies at RCSI-B. Conclusions: The 15 h spent educating RCSI-B medical students on nutrition is inadequate according to international recommendations. However, RCSI-B is one of many medical schools that do not reach the minimum required hours (25–44) as set by the National Academy of Sciences and the American Society for Nutrition. We recommend that more teaching hours on nutrition be introduced into the curriculum. These extra teaching hours may greatly benefit RCSI-B students, patients and public health in Bahrain. © 2015, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.

In this paper we propose myPTutor, a general and effective approach which uses AI planning techniques to create fully tailored learning routes, as sequences of Learning Objects (LOs) that fit the pedagogical and students' requirements. myPTutor has a potential applicability to support e-learning personalization by producing, and automatically solving, a planning model from (and to) e-learning standards in a vast number of real scenarios, from small to medium/large e-learning communities. Our experiments demonstrate that we can solve scenarios with large courses and a high number of students. Therefore, it is perfectly valid for schools, high schools and universities, especially if they already use Moodle, on top of which we have implemented myPTutor. It is also of practical significance for repairing unexpected discrepancies (while the students are executing their learning routes) by using a Case-Based Planning adaptation process that reduces the differences between the original and the new route, thus enhancing the learning process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Background: Sex and Gender Medicine is a novel discipline that provides equitable medical care for society and improves outcomes for both male and female patients. The integration of sex- and gender-specific knowledge into medical curricula is limited due to adequate learning material, systematic teacher training and an innovative communication strategy. We aimed at initiating an e-learning and knowledge-sharing platform for Sex and Gender Medicine, the eGender platform (http://egender.charite.de), to ensure that future doctors and health professionals will have adequate knowledge and communication skills on sex and gender differences in order to make informed decisions for their patients. Methods: The web-based eGender knowledge-sharing platform was designed to support the blended learning pedagogical teaching concept and follows the didactic concept of constructivism. Learning materials developed by Sex and Gender Medicine experts of seven universities have been used as the basis for the new learning tools. The content of these tools is patient-centered and provides add-on information on gender-sensitive aspects of diseases. The structural part of eGender was designed and developed using the open source e-learning platform Moodle. The eGender platform comprises an English and a German version of e-learning modules: one focusing on basic knowledge and seven on specific medical disciplines. Each module consists of several courses corresponding to a disease or symptom complex. Self-organized learning has to be managed by using different learning tools, e.g., texts and audiovisual material, tools for online communication and collaborative work. Results: More than 90 users from Europe registered for the eGender Medicine learning modules. The most frequently accessed module was "Gender Medicine - Basics" and the users favored discussion forums. These e-learning modules fulfill the quality criteria for higher education and are used within the elective Master Module "Gender Medicine - Basics" implemented into the accredited Master of Public Health at Charité - Berlin. Conclusions: The eGender platform is a flexible and user-friendly electronical knowledge-sharing platform providing evidence-based high-quality learning material used by a growing number of registered users. The eGender Medicine learning modules could be key in the reform of medical curricula to integrate Sex and Gender Medicine into the education of health professionals. © 2016 The Author(s).

Modern education is hard to imagine without the use of e-learning tools, but still the transition from traditional “paper-and-pencil” examining to electronic exams is to some extent cautious. Although course administration and exam evaluation are much easier with learning management systems, there are concerns among teaching staff, that electronic tests simplify examination process compared to paper tests and classic examining. At the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering, e-learning tools are used at several exams, mostly as a secondary tool to aid with laboratory exercises. In this paper, we show our experience with four courses from the computer engineering study program that are to various extent moved to Moodle LMS, and electronic examining. We mostly concentrate on certain aspects of transition from paper tests to electronic exams. We present 12 different transformations needed to conform to electronic examining and automated evaluation, and discuss benefits and drawbacks of such a transition. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper reveals the main trends and characteristics of the use of multimedia means in distance learning of technical subjects at graduate schools; analyses the peculiarities of presentation and perception of information in multimedia environment; studies genre and topic structure of multimedia means used for distance learning. The author has developed a technology of distance learning for teaching such subjects as “Theoretical Mechanics” and “Material Mechanics”; the technology is based on the use of tests and test training setsin the theory course, which is accompanied by video materials filmed during lectures and practical seminars. A distance learning system will allow to: educate an unlimited number of students during unlimited time; check the student knowledge during the exams, track and control study results and dynamics for each student regardless of his/her physical location, create exclusive online courses based on traditional courses of experienced educators, significantly reduce in-class hours for full-time students, therefore, reducing the resources spent on office facilities, significantly increase the profits of school comparing to those received from traditional education. The Moodle system, which is an application for online learning, was used as the basis for the online course. The most useful multimedia technologies as well as technologies requiring improvements have been identified. The promising option of multimedia technology with the use of virtual reality has been proposed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Background: This paper presents the results of a study of the Monsys monitoring system, an educational support tool designed to prevent and control the dropout rate in a distance learning course in family health. Developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA, Monsys was created to enable data mining in the virtual learning environment known as Moodle. Methods: This is an exploratory study using documentary and bibliographic research and analysis of the Monsys database. Two classes (2010 and 2011) were selected as research subjects, one with Monsys intervention and the other without. The samples were matched (using a ration of 1:1) by gender, age, marital status, graduation year, previous graduation status, location and profession. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression model with a 5 % significance level. Results: The findings show that the dropout rate in the class in which Monsys was not employed (2010) was 43.2 %. However, the dropout rate in the class of 2011, in which the tool was employed as a pedagogical team aid, was 30.6 %. After statistical adjustment, the Monsys monitoring system remained in correlation with the course completion variable (adjusted OR = 1.74, IC95% = 1.17-2.59; p = 0.005), suggesting that the use of the Monsys tool, isolated to the adjusted variables, can enhance the likelihood that students will complete the course. Using the chi-square test, a profile analysis of students revealed a higher completion rate among women (67.7 %) than men (52.2 %). Analysis of age demonstrated that students between 40 and 49 years dropped out the least (32.1 %) and, with regard to professional training, nurses have the lowest dropout rates (36.3 %). Conclusions: The use of Monsys significantly reduced the dropout, with results showing greater association between the variables denoting presence of the monitoring system and female gender. © 2016 The Author(s).

The use of e-learning technology is incontestably recognized as an important and integral part of the educational process. Considerable research studies are carried out in order to apprehend how effective and usable e-learning systems. In this paper, an empirical-based study is conducted to explore how lecturers interact with an e-learning environment based on a predefined task model describing low-level interactions. Client-side log data is collected from university lecturers from the Electrical and Computer Science departments. Subsequently, data analysis is conducted to infer the usability degree from the estimated usage metrics together with further exploratory analysis from user feedback via System Usability Scale. Experimental results reveal that the System Usability Scale score is not a sufficient measure to express the true acceptance and satisfaction level of lecturers for using the e-learning systems. The evaluation must be fulfilled in tandem with analyzing the usage metrics derived from interaction traces in a non-intrusive fashion. The proposed approach is a milestone towards usability evaluation to improve the acceptance and user experience for academic staff and students. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the development of an institution wide approach to learning analytics at the University of Wollongong (UOW) and the inclusion of library data drawn from the Library Cube. Design/methodology/approach – The Student Support and Education Analytics team at UOW is tasked with creating policy, frameworks and infrastructure for the systematic capture, mapping and analysis of data from the across the university. The initial data set includes: log file data from Moodle sites, Library Cube, student administration data, tutorials and student support service usage data. Using the learning analytics data warehouse UOW is developing new models for analysis and visualisation with a focus on the provision of near real-time data to academic staff and students to optimise learning opportunities. Findings – The distinct advantage of the learning analytics model is that the selected data sets are updated weekly, enabling near real-time monitoring and intervention where required. Inclusion of library data with the other often disparate data sets from across the university has enabled development of a comprehensive platform for learning analytics. Future work will include the development of predictive models using the rapidly growing learning analytics data warehouse. Practical implications – Data warehousing infrastructure, the systematic capture and exporting of relevant library data sets are requisite for the consideration of library data in learning analytics. Originality/value – What was not anticipated five years ago when the Value Cube was first realised, was the development of learning analytic services at UOW. The Cube afforded University of Wollongong Library considerable advantage: the framework for data harvesting and analysis was established, ready for inclusion within learning analytics data sets and subsequent reporting to faculty. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Aim: The use of electronic portfolios in university learning, including within dietetic education, is increasing. We aimed to implement and evaluate an ePortfolio model as part of a final year undergraduate foodservice management unit. The qualitative evaluation focused on the relationships between different modes of eLearning. Methods: A randomised parallel model study design was implemented, with the cohort of 52 students allocated to two different ePortfolio approaches. One student group received a blended learning teaching and learning model via the traditional study only Moodle ePortfolio. The second group received the enhanced Mahara ePortfolio through a supported online ePortfolio platform. Focus groups with study groups (Moodle ePortfolio, n = 16 students and Mahara ePorfolio, n = 15 students) were facilitated by an independent researcher. Focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed with data analysed separately and then together. Use of thematic analysis enabled comparisons to be made between the two ePortfolio experiences. Results: Thematic analysis found broad themes of satisfaction and supporting learning consistently across both ePortfolio models. Satisfaction was related to both achievement and creativity of portfolio production. Subthemes related to supporting learning included: students requiring support with implementation of new technology, and more clearly defined assessment tasks to improve compatibility with the Mahara ePortfolio. Conclusions: This research has provided key learnings for the incorporation of ePortfolios into foodservice management education, enabling unit content to meet the needs and expectations of students. Foodservice management competencies can be developed and demonstrated within ePortfolios as part of a blended learning approach. © 2015 Dietitians Association of Australia

Ensuring the best teaching quality and promoting the critical thinking and hands-on experience of students are main concerns in the continuous development plan of the laboratories in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the American University of Beirut. To this end, laboratory course materials are not only subject to constant updates, but also innovative teaching methods and evaluation techniques are developed. This paper outlines a new teaching methodology and novel academic Moodle-based evaluation techniques applied in a lab environment specific to Electric Circuits Laboratory which is a basic required course for all students majoring either in Computer and Communications Engineering or in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. The objectives of this course are to familiarize students with various circuit and electronic devices and their applications, to teach them how to use basic laboratory instruments, and to introduce them to laboratory techniques to implement and analyze electronic circuits. The motivation to implement the new changes was due to many observations and problems encountered while teaching the course for several years. The inventive teaching and evaluation approach have been applied so far for three semesters. Significant improvement in students' comprehension of the material, depicted in a considerable increase in class average of the final exam, proved the success of the adopted method. Besides, an increase in class participation and involvement was noticed and course assessment done by students scored very high. © The Author(s) 2015.

The processes of knowledge building, the interaction and participation of students in an online collaborative learning environment and the relations among them are investigated. The investigation involved a procedure carried out over 14 weeks in an online collaborative learning environment. During the procedure, the knowledge building process was executed over Knowledge Forum and the planning process over Moodle LMS. The scaffolds, quantity, content and quality of interaction and participation, and relations between scaffolds and the quantity of interaction and participation were reviewed. The participants were 145 prospective teachers. In this research, a convergent parallel design method was employed. Data were collected from multiple sources, including the log records and the content analysis of Knowledge Forum postings. Development was observed in terms of the use of opinion building and expressing forms and note creation and build-on of the students in the knowledge building processes within the online collaborative learning environment. Furthermore, most of the academic content and the quality of interaction and participation were indicators of progress of the individual student and groups of students. There was a significant increase in the quality of interaction and participation from the beginning of the term to the end of term. It is suggested that the 14-week knowledge building process contributed to learning. It was found that there was a significant relation between the use of opinion building and expressing forms and the creation and build-on of notes by the students. Results show that the course offered in an online collaborative knowledge building environment contributed to opinion building and expression, the quantity, content and quality of interaction and participation, and thus the learning of students. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of Learning Management Systems has grown exponentially in the last several years and has come to have a strong effect on the teaching-learning process, particularly in higher education. The present study intends to examine students' asynchronous learning processes via an Educational Data Mining approach using data extracted from the Moodle logs of students who were grouped according to similar behaviors regarding effort, time spent working, and procrastination. The behaviors were then matched with different levels of achievement. First, the different patterns of students' involvement in the learning process in a Learning Management System were clustered. Second, the different variables selected from the Moodle records were studied to see if they were equally suitable for the configuration of student clusters. Third, the relationships between those patterns to students' final marks were examined. After analyzing the log data gathered from a Moodle 2.0 course in which 140 undergraduate students were enrolled, four different patterns of learning with different final marks were found. Additional results showed that there are variables more related to achievement and more suitable to group the students on the basis of which the different groups were characterized, namely, two Task Oriented Groups (socially or individually focused) and two Non Task Oriented Groups (procrastinators or non-procrastinators). These results have implications in the design of interventions for improving students' learning processes and achievement in LMSs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the number of formative e-tests taken differed by gender, using students' perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate. The sample was 340 teacher candidates reached through purposeful sampling. The study lasted a semester; students were involved in a blended learning environment where classroom lessons supported by self-regulatory e-tests as a part of an online course management system, called MOODLE. It was possible for students to take 10-item online quizzes and 20-item practice tests as many as they wanted. In the analysis, a factorial ANOVA design was applied. Findings indicated a moderate correlation between the number of formative e-tests taken and the perceived self-regulation levels, indicating higher perceived self-regulation levels as the number of formative e-tests increased. By using perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate, the gender differences in the number of e-tests taken were also investigated. According to finding, gender variable did not explain the differences in the compound variable "the number of formative e-tests". However, after controlling for the effect of perceived self-regulation, the findings were significant. Hence, we can conclude that self-regulated behavior is independent of students' gender; therefore, e-assessments is a self-regulated, technology-based instructional aid in higher education. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: Assess and trend student opinions of online educational components utilized in a redesigned 5-week foundational drug information course. Comparison of performance on the final examination, course grade, and changes in standardized university course evaluations between 2012 and 2013 were the secondary objectives. Methods: This course used narrated video instruction coupled with the use of a face-to-face weekly laboratory session. This project consisted of pre- and post-exposure surveys to allow for paired analysis of six opinion-based survey items using a five-point Likert scale. Secondary objectives were compared between the 2013 and 2012 entering classes by use of paired t-tests. Results: Only matched pairs were analyzed for this project (n = 65 of 127 enrolled students; 51.2%). Changes between mean pre- and post-survey results indicated a decline in student favorability for traditional lecture styles (difference = -0.49 points; p < 0.05) and a decline in the importance of face-to-face interaction with instructors outside class (difference = -0.46 points; p < 0.05) while demonstrating increased favorability for use of online video demonstrations as an acceptable substitute for in-person demonstration of skills (difference = 0.34 points; p < 0.05) and increased rating of overall preference of online learning compared to traditional modalities (difference = 0.44 points; p < 0.05). Standardized course evaluations did not differ between 2012 and 2013. Mean final exam scores significantly increased from 84.86% in 2012 to 88.99% in 2013 (p < 0.05), but no difference between mean course grades (94.03% and 93.62%, respectively; p > 0.05). Conclusion: Blended course design is an effective format for introductory skills-based professional pharmacy courses. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents the "Multi-Role Project" method (MRP), a broadly applicable project-based learning method, and describes its implementation and evaluation in the context of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) course. The MRP method is designed around a meta-principle that considers the project learning activity as a role-playing game based on two projects: a learning project and an engineering project. The meta-principle is complemented by five principles that provide a framework to guide the working practices of student teams: distribution of responsibilities; regular interactions and solicitations within the team; anticipation and continuous improvement; positive interdependence and alternating individual/collective work; and open communication and content management. This paper presents the implementation of MRP in a course teaching software engineering, UML language, and project management. The results show that MRP helped the course's students to acquire important professional knowledge and skills, experience near-real-world professional realities, and develop their abilities to work both in teams and autonomously. © 2015 IEEE.

Siette supports different assessment methods - including classical test theory, item response theory, and computer adaptive testing - and integrates them with multidimensional student models used by intelligent educational systems. Teachers can use an authoring tool to create large item pools of different types of questions, including multiple choice, open answer, generative questions, and complex tasks. Siette can be used for formative and summative assessment and incorporates different learning elements, including scaffolding features, such as hints, feedback, and misconceptions. It includes numerous other features covering different educational needs and techniques, such as spaced repetition, collaborative testing, or pervasive learning. Siette is designed as a web-based assessment component that can be semantically integrated with intelligent systems or with large LMSs, such as Moodle. This article reviews the evolution of the Siette system, presents information on its use, and analyses this information from a broader and critical perspective on the use of intelligent systems in education. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

Background: Emergency clerkships expose students to a stressful environment that require multiple tasks, which may have a direct impact on cognitive load and motivation for learning. To address this challenge, Cognitive Load Theory and Self Determination Theory provided the conceptual frameworks to the development of a Moodle-based online Emergency Medicine course, inspired by real clinical cases. Methods: Three consecutive classes (2013-2015) of sixth-year medical students (n = 304) participated in the course, during a curricular and essentially practical emergency rotation. "Virtual Rounds" provided weekly virtual patients in narrative format and meaningful schemata to chief complaints, in order to simulate real rounds at Emergency Unit. Additional activities such as Extreme Decisions, Emergency Quiz and Electrocardiographic challenge offered different views of emergency care. Authors assessed student's participation and its correlation with their academic performance. A survey evaluated students' opinions. Students graduating in 2015 answered an online questionnaire to investigate cognitive load and motivation. Results: Each student produced 1965 pageviews and spent 72 hours logged on. Although Clinical Emergency rotation has two months long, students accessed the online course during an average of 5.3 months. Virtual Rounds was the most accessed activity, and there was positive correlations between the number of hours logged on the platform and final grades on Emergency Medicine. Over 90% of students felt an improvement in their clinical reasoning and considered themselves better prepared for rendering Emergency care. Considering a Likert scale from 1 (minimum load) to 7 (maximum load), the scores for total cognitive load were 4.79±2.2 for Virtual Rounds and 5.56±1.96 for real medical rounds(p<0,01). Conclusions: A real-world inspired online course, based on cognitive and motivational conceptual frameworks, seems to be a strong tool to engage students in learning. It may support them to manage the cognitive challenges involved in clinical care and increase their motivation for learning. © 2016 de Araujo Guerra Grangeia et al.

In traditional e-learning, teachers design sets of Learning Objects (LOs) and organize their sequencing; the material implementing the LOs could be either built anew or adopted from elsewhere (e.g. from standard-compliant repositories) and reused. This task is applicable also when the teacher works in a system for personalized e-learning. In this case, the burden actually increases: for instance, the LOs may need adaptation to the system, through additional metadata. This paper presents a module that gives some support to the operations of retrieving, analyzing, and importing LOs from a set of standard Learning Objects Repositories, acting as a recommending system. In particular, it is designed to support the teacher in the phases of (i) retrieval of LOs, through a keyword-based search mechanism applied to the selected repositories; (ii) analysis of the returned LOs, whose information is enriched by a concept of relevance metric, based on both the results of the searching operation and the data related to the previous use of the LOs in the courses managed by the Learning Management System; and (iii) LO importation into the course under construction. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

This article illustrates the experience of introducing e-assessment to a foundational ICT networking course for a ‘large’ group of first-year students at a South African Higher Education Institution. The study employed a mix of participatory action research, systems design, and survey (quantitative and qualitative) analysis over an academic year across two semesters. Although much research has been conducted on teaching in ICT, the purposeful pedagogical use of electronic assessment is limited. The results provide insight into the need for ‘extending’ the scholarship of teaching and learning to the scholarship of teaching, learning and assessment. While the research has some limitations in longitudinal and comparison studies, it is useful to students, teaching instructors, lecturers and administrators as it provides key thoughts as guidelines for introducing and using e-assessments as platforms for active learning, and as a basis for future research into the use of e-assessment for high-stake summative assessment. © 2016 University of South Africa.

Worldwide web has evolved in the world. Traditional teaching which is instructing and learning in the classroom proceeding with face-to-face lectures is one of the most effective teaching methods. However, when combined with offline and online classroom lessons the greatest synergistic effect appears. The advantage of online learning is that self-directed learning is possible In other words, the quality of online content is very important. The percentage share of online video lecture content is showing explosive growth. Therefore, the importance of LMS (Learning Management System) technology to provide infrastructure for online classes is increasing. There are several online educational open source software in existence, but unlike the others, the Moodle LMS is based on the philosophy of social constructivism. However Moodle LMS is difficult to apply in real-time and fast-changing media technology. In this paper, it shows for a technology to play back the HD video format such as MP4 in a variety of devices, we tested open source video players based on HTML5 and JavaScript and then studied how to apply to Moodle LMS. To do this, we first developed standard guidelines to select a web video player for Moodle LMS. And then through the developed guidelines we selected an open-source video player and implemented it in the Moodle LMS. In particular, this study excluded non-standard Web technologies and was only conducted by standard Web technologies. As a result, a variety of devices became available for online educational support. For global education with non-wired internet infrastructure, Moodle LMS will be able to take advantage for a better way. © 2016 International Information Institute.

Students in the digital era are habitual of using digital devices not only for playing and interacting with their friends and peers, but also as a tool for education and learning. These digital natives are highly obsessed with the internet driven portable devices and always demand for a multimedia rich content. This specific demand needs to be addressed by college teachers in the teaching -learning pedagogy design and implementation. The integration of pervasive computing in traditional classroom pedagogy can boost new learning experience for cyber savvy students in higher education. Learning Management System (LMS) as a pervasive computing can be embedded in classroom pedagogy to support learning inside and outside the classroom. LMS can play a supportive role to teachers and administrators in higher education to facilitate them in their work. This becomes more significant to the teachers and administrators, when the LMS is based upon the cloud computing platform. This paper explores the significance of various components of cloud-based open source Moodle Learning Management System with a specific focus on teachers and administrators in higher education. A learning theory approach has been followed to map the requirements of the teachers and the administrators and specific cases and examples have been presented. © 2016, IGI Global.

In this paper, benefits and advantages arising from virtualization technologies, applied to the field of distance education, are discussed and highlighted. MOODLE (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Management System), the most widely used LMS (Learning Management System), and a virtualization system, based on Xen hypervisor, are combined in order to create an effective e-learning environment. Commonly, the main problem about MOODLE concerns the server workload, due to several factors, which results in a saturation of physical devices. To bypass this limit, the over-centralized load is deployed on a dynamic virtual machine. Experimental results prove that the proposed system can improve performances, produce low connection time and provide a powerful distance education environment. © 2016, Italian e-Learning Association.

The use of e-learning has been recommended for all levels of the educational system, thus in higher education as well. However, e-learning is very often reduced to downloading teaching materials from teachers’ websites. Students rarely participate in forums discussing some teaching topics, and they even less frequently use a learning management system in their educational process (Dukić & Mađarić, 2012). Among learning management systems, the web application Moodle, which is based on the principles of constructivism and constructionism, is particularly popular. Constructivism assumes that learning is a social process where individuals learn through interacting with other people (Pritchard & Woollard, 2010), while constructionism additionally includes correlation of knowledge and social action (Burr, 2003). To encourage students to learn through interaction, we conducted an action research with the attempt to explore the possibilities of initiating discussions on the network forum of the Moodle system. The research was organised within the Pedagogy course in the first year of teacher studies over two academic years. The most important advantages of this way of learning proved to be freedom and flexibility of participation, the possibility of exchanging experiences and ideas, reflection and collaborative learning. Discussions on web forums have also shown certain deficiencies such as inadequate and unequal activity of all participants, lack of connection to the discussions of other participants (monologue form of writing), lack of criticism, lengthy texts, technical problems and the problem of availability of computers connected to the Internet. This research has shown that it is possible to organise constructivist e-learning in which higher education students will enjoy participating. © 2016, FACTEACHEREDUCATION. All rights reserved.

Web-based learning environments are being more widely used in higher education to support face to face teaching activities. Universities in Europe, the United States, and other developed countries extensively use e-learning platforms; however, this is still in the trial stage in Chinese universities and educational institutions. Moodle has been considered as an interactive e-learning tool to motivate students and involve them in resolving both individual and collaborative tasks. In order to improve class attendance and homework assignments submission, an e-course was developed via Moodle and proved to be a positive teaching/ learning experience. Following this study, a series of conclusions can be drawn concerning its benefits in terms of stimulating students' interest in homework tasks and increasing their frequency of interaction with teachers and among colleagues.

Educational laboratories are places for realizing experimentations and they are important for modern engineering education. The problem is what if there are simply not enough devices or time for conducting experimentation in a local lab? Other factors that prevent the use of local lab devices directly by students are inaccessible or dangerous phenomena, or polluting chemical reactions. The new technologies bring additional strategies of learning and teaching, so it becomes a challenge to integrate the information and communication technologies ICT into the engineering sciences learning. Nowadays, there are two types of online labs, virtual and remote labs. Virtual labs that provide simulation environments for experimentations, remote labs are based on conducting the experimentation remotely through the Internet. In this paper, an example of a successful development and deployment of a cloud based remote lab in the field of engineering education, integrated in the Moodle platform, using very low-coast, high documented devices and free software. The remote lab is user friendly for both trainers and students.

Some research in physics teaching in secondary schools shows that cooperative learning has the potential to improve student performance. Moodle is a learning management system that has open source platform modules that can be customised according to user's needs. The purpose of this study is to figure out the effectiveness of combination between the advantages of cooperative learning and e-learning as blended learning. The research objective is to see the effect of cooperative-blended learning strategy to the learning performance on physics in high school grade XII. This research is pre-test- post-test control group design using motivation as covariate. The dependent variable is a learning strategy. The independent variable is a learning achievement. The result showed that students who were taught using cooperative learning had higher learning achievement than those taught using face-to-face learning. Motivation can be used as predictor on cooperativeblended learning. Student who had higher motivation tend to get better learning achievement. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article presents a critical action research of three curriculum managers (managers) who used Moodle visions to manage their school curriculum at a school in Durban, South Africa. The curriculum managers’ main aim of using Moodle was to improve teacher and learner performance. The purpose of the study was to explore the managers’ reflections on their use of visions of Moodle for curriculum management. The managers’ reflective journals, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussion were used for data generation. Purposive and convenience samplings were used to select the three most easily accessible participants. The managers’ reflections on curriculum management through Moodle visions (personal, social and professional) suggest new strategies for curriculum management (habitual, opinion and factual). The study concluded that the managers understood/learned new strategies of managing curriculum through their reflections on their use of visions for the use of Moodle. This article consequently recommends the use of Moodle visions for curriculum management and the incorporation of a reflective process to help managers to interrogate their past and present in order to generate new strategies to improve future management knowledge/skills. © 2016, Foundation for Education Science and Technology.

Remote practical experiences are nowadays essentialin the context of distance education, because studentscannot use face-to-face traditional laboratories. These remotelaboratories can be used by faculty within virtualclassrooms, so that students can carry out their on-lineexperiments in a ubiquitous way-from anywhere and atany time. But these activities cannot be isolated from thelearning process of students. Therefore, the services providedby a remote laboratory must be integrated into the institutionalLearning Management System (LMS), in order tobe employed during the whole learning process. In thiswork, a fully-functional example of the integration of service-oriented remote laboratories into a LMS is presented,where the Moodle platform has been chosen as a representativeLMS.

This paper is concerned with an essential topic in e-learning - course content authoring. Besides supporting the concept of Competence-Based Learning (CBL) our solution is aiming to make effective use of an open integration architecture fostering the interoperability of hybrid e-learning solutions. Modern scenarios ask for interoperable software solutions to seamlessly integrate existing e-learning infrastructures and legacy tools with innovative technologies while being cognitively efficient to handle. In this way, prospective users are enabled to use them seamlessly without learning overheads. At the same time, methods of Learning Design (LD) in combination with CBL are getting more and more important to produce and maintain easy to facilitate solutions. Our approach of developing a competence-based course-authoring and assignment-support software bridges the gaps between Moodle and established legacy infrastructures by embedding existing legacy tools via Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). The underlying conceptual architecture for this integration approach and its components will be introduced; furthermore a Moodle plugin will be outlined, which enables Moodle for LD- and CBL-support including corresponding data exchange with our course authoring tool. The paper concludes with an outlook on future plans for our research and development.

Assessment in education employing web tools, also known as e-assessment, deals with the effective use of technology to support successful instruction. The aim of this study was to investigate learning outcomes and the students' attitudes to online Moodle quizzes in order to improve instructional design. The research population included 204 college students enrolled in life sciences who were participating in an introductory physics course. A blended learning model was used, based on large, traditional faceto- face lectures, practice sessions held with smaller groups of about 25 students and a rich Moodle learning environment. The students' knowledge and understanding were assessed weekly throughout the semester, using two different methods: three ordinary short written tests and online quizzes in the Moodle environment. The students' attitudes towards the online quizzes as compared to the written tests were investigated by questionnaire. Results indicate that both the average grade on written tests and the average grade on online quizzes were found to be significant predictors of the grade on the final exam. Students significantly improved their scores and greatly shortened their performance time on the last attempts of the online quiz, as compared to their first attempts. The investigation into the students' attitudes towards online quizzes reveals a generally positive attitude. Learning outcomes and the students' attitudes to online Moodle quizzes were considered to improve instructional design, which demonstrates formative assessment in higher education.

The use of data mining in the education sector has increased in the recent past. One reason for this is the wide use of learning management systems (LMS), which store data related to learning activities. The goal of this research is to predict individual learning styles using the Moodle LMS by analyzing log data using a data mining technique. We use the Waikato environment for knowledge analysis (Weka), as the data mining tool and compare the differences in the performance of several data mining techniques using course log data. Our experimental results show that the J48 decision tree classification algorithm works best with our dataset. We also propose a group learning map that visualizes the learning styles in a class, which can help instructors and learners achieve learning outcomes more effectively. © 2016 Information Processing Society of Japan.

This study explores the impact of electronic portfolios on undergraduate learning in higher education. Based on a descriptive study, it analyses the prospective teacher's perception of use of these tools (electronic portfolio in Moodle-Mahara, in the institutional environment of a university in southern Europe), examining the variables participation, autonomous learning, and motivation. The results show no increase in motivation, but they do show an increase in autonomy, especially a progressive increase in the student's online participation in a blended learning context. The results show a positive correlation between the variables participation and university student's performance. Research into the uses and impact of electronic portfolios on undergraduates has implications for improving educational practice by fostering increased participation and autonomous learning.

Measuring the learning effectiveness of Kampo Medicine (KM) education is challenging. The aim of this study was to develop a web-based test to measure the learning effectiveness of KM education among medical students (MSs). We used an open-source Moodle platform to test 30 multiple-choice questions classified into 8-type fields (eight basic concepts of KM) including "qi-blood-fluid" and "five-element" theories, on 117 fourth-year MSs. The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) score on the web-based test was 30.2 ± 11.9 (/100). The correct answer rate ranged from 17% to 36%. A pattern-based portfolio enabled these rates to be individualized in terms of KM proficiency. MSs with scores higher (n = 19) or lower (n = 14) than mean ± 1SD were defined as high or low achievers, respectively. Cluster analysis using the correct answer rates for the 8-type field questions revealed clear divisions between high and low achievers. Interestingly, each high achiever had a different proficiency pattern. In contrast, three major clusters were evident among low achievers, all of whom responded with a low percentage of or no correct answers. In addition, a combination of three questions accurately classified high and low achievers. These findings suggest that our web-based test allows individual quantitative assessment of the learning effectiveness of KM education among MSs. © 2016 Norio Iizuka et al.

Purpose: In higher education, blended learning is already strongly established. The e-courses vary in their structure, assignments, prompt examinations, interaction between students and teachers, etc. Such aspects may influence the students’ perception of usefulness of blended learning. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors which influence that feeling and to look for possible differences in perception by different subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: Students in the survey evaluated 13 aspects of e-courses in which they were enrolled. From enrolment documents, additional demographic data were collected (gender, high-school grade, study programme, etc.). A multiple linear regression was used with perceived usefulness as the response variable and the 12 other e-course aspects as predictors. Further, the same regression analysis was performed on different subgroups of students based on demographical data. Findings: The empirical results showed that the general impression regarding the e-courses, their consistency with the face-to-face teaching and the teachers’ responsiveness had a significant influence on the students’ perception of the usefulness of e-courses. Further analysis based on demographic data revealed several subgroups of students where the perception of usefulness was influenced by different aspects. The teachers’ feedback and supplementing the tutorial play an important role in higher years of study, while the general impression loses its influence. Originality/value: The paper is the first to explore the importance of demographic determinants of perceived usefulness of e-learning tools in EAPAA (European Association of Public Administration Accreditation)-accredited undergraduate public administration programmes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The research in question investigates the technologies of initiating independent activity within the framework of distance learning and their psychological aspects. The authors’ classification of educational technologies of initiating students into independent cognitive activity is presented. Such technologies utilize various psychological mechanisms of exciting students’ cognitive interest, intensifying cognitive processes, developing independent activity skills, and, as a result, increase motivation for independent activity and learning on the whole. These include such types of technologies as developmental technologies, interactive technologies, technologies of information transfer, technologies of meaning-making initiation. The research of the attitude of distance learning educators to independent activity of students and the content of the academic courses were done at Moodle-based education programs. The findings show the differences in retention rate among distance learning educators whose competence in terms of initiating students into independent (self-guided) activity varies. It’s emphasized that interactive lectures, videoconferences, audio-visual aids, interactive seminars, glossaries, interactive tests are considered the most efficient technologies in initiating students into independent (self-guided) activity. The obtained results have made it possible to stress the developmental effect of distance learning technologies and the technologies of initiating students into independent (self-guided) activity in various psychic spheres of students: cognitive, individual, emotional. We mention the changes in motivational sphere of students and their meaning-making activity. In the course of correct development of distance learning we notice the development of voluntary and nonvoluntary cognitive activity. A student starts actively participating in educational process, he becomes the creator of his own world. © 2016 IJCRSEE. All rights reserved.

During the last years many different tools have appeared devoted to facilitate the communication between teachers and students in a classroom. Most of these solutions, commonly referred to as Interactive Response Systems, are closed, too rigid, and in many cases too expensive for educational institutions. In this work we present an extended and improved version of the OpenIRS-UCM application, a free, easy to use and open source tool which supports diverse clickers, can be run in different platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS) and is totally integrated with the well-known Moodle Learning Management System. We evaluate the OpenIRS-UCM application in terms of various software quality metrics (program complexity and usability), the level of acceptance currently achieved and its potential adoption in real life settings. Also, we perform an exhaustive comparison of the features that our application provides to those of various commercial tools, which reveals that OpenIRS-UCMexhibits many advantages over other major IRS players. Finally, we detail how our tool represents a remarkable advance in the research areas of engineering learning systems and engineering assessment. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.

Technology is constantly evolving in more sophisticated forms giving new opportunities for educators to transfer learning into virtual space. New educational technology trends are associated today with blended learning where traditional methods of teaching merge with online sessions. Blended learning with its learner-centered approach has a potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. Russian higher institutions embrace this technology as a strategy to engage and motivate students and thereby augment the learning process. The paper studies students' engagement and satisfaction with the online courses and their overall perception from learners' perspective. The findings could serve as a reference point to promote online courses and to achieve considerable educational benefits.

Motivation is a key factor in education. However, learning systems typically do not directly consider motivational aspects to increase students’ motivation. While there are a few systems that tapped into this area, they use either one motivational technique that can be applied in different settings or multiple motivational techniques that are then bound to a specific setting (e.g. a specific course/topic). In this paper, we propose the design, implementation and verification of four motivational techniques as well as a tracking mechanism to gather information on how students use the respective techniques. These techniques are system independent and content independent, and can therefore be used in any learning system and for any course. The motivational techniques were integrated into Moodle and verified through case studies. By integrating motivational techniques into learning systems, students can benefit from increased motivation, which again can have a positive impact on their overall performance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.

This paper presents two interactive visualization tools for learning management systems (LMS) in order to improve learning and teaching in online courses. The first tool was developed at the Intelligent Information Systems Laboratory (IISLab) at the Tampere University of Technology (TUT). The tool is used to analyse students' activity from automatically recorded user log data and to build interactive visualizations. They provide valuable insights into the learning process and participation of students in a course offered to teachers and students. The second tool was developed at the Unitelma Sapienza University. It extends navigation and search functionalities in the discussion forum of an LMS with a topic-driven paradigm. The tool analyses forum content and automatically identifies discussion topics. It then enhances the original forum with a topic-driven navigation structure and an interactive search graph. Both tools have been developed as plug-ins for the Moodle LMS, but their analysis processes and techniques can be adopted into any LMS. © 2016, IGI Global.

Instructional design (ID) models are proven prescriptive techniques for qualitative lessons that could guarantee learning. Existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) miss-out the roles of this important quality control mechanism by providing a mere plane and passive platform for content authoring, thus becomes vulnerable for poor instructional design. This paper demonstrates an effort to ameliorate this limitation by extending the IEEE Learning Technology System Architecture (LTSA) with ID design processes. The Use Case diagram, Activities diagram and Entity Relation diagram for the extended LTSA are presented. The extended architecture was implemented on Moodle open sourced LMS which was extended and hosted live. Students' impressions on the functionalities and operational effects of the platform were collated using online survey. The academic effects of the platform on the students' performance were determined using the class mean. The value obtained was compared with that of the control group in the same session and those from the previous sessions. Consequently, this work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating ID models in E-learning. It also justifies its effects on the quality of learning.

Courses in virtual learning environments can leave recently enrolled participants in a state of loneliness, confusion and boredom. . What course content is essential in the course, where can more information be found and which assignments are mandatory? Research has stated that learner control and motivation are crucial issues for successful online education. This paper presents and discusses visualisation as a channel to improve learner’s control and understanding of programming concepts and gamification as a way to increase study motivation in virtual learning environments. Data has been collected by evaluation questionnaires and group discussions in two courses partly given in the Moodle virtual learning environment. One course is on Game based learning for Bachelor’s programmes, the other is a course on e-learning for university teachers. Both the courses have used progress bars to visualise students’ study paths and digital badges for gamification. Results have also been discussed with teachers and pedagogues at a department for computer and systems sciences. Furthermore, two visualisation prototypes have been designed, developed and evaluated in programming lectures. Findings indicate that visualisation by progress bars is a good way to improve course participants’ overview in online environments with rich and multifaceted content. To what degree the visualisation facilitates the course completion is hard to estimate, and like students have different learning styles, they also seem to have different visualisation needs. Gamification by digital badges seems to have various motivational impacts in different study groups and in traditional university programmes the traditional grades seem to be the main carrots. Finally, it seems that software visualisation might be a promising path to enhance programming education in the 21st century. © 2015, Academic Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

Digital game for learning or Serious Game for Learning (SGfL) need to be developed and refined at many level of abstraction, in particular to address concerns from education experts about aspects of learning are applied in the gaming interaction. This paper will explain about learning model that comply to be implemented in (SGfL) to make its design can be accounted for pedagogics and for high flexibility in subject/domain that be learned. Instructional design that suitable with cause-effect flow model (from Mihalyi) are inquiry based learning with flexible guidance and situated learning within meaningful learning context. Question or problem based in inquiry model was suitable with task based in flow model. Situated learning that need autothelic learning context is have same concept with immersion, especially about modeling reality. Transformation the instructional model into game design was inspired by The SIM Career. The proposed SGfL’s genre is role playing and simulation of life game as profesional. TASK was transformed into working. For life, player must work. For get job position, player must have a competency certificate through Training. In working, player must complete a task. By completing the task, player learning by doing. The elements in the gameworld design adapted to the field of work, so that the player feels like working on a real-world environment. From this point can be concluded that gameworld could not be domain independent, because environment of working is dependent on the domain learned (learning context). The task completion interaction was managed like quiz or test in Moodle. It was not soo good from immersion aspect but high flexibility, so can be domain independent. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to determine whether e-learning as a new teaching concept was acceptable for second-year undergraduates and to compare attitudes and exam results of students who followed electronic compared with classroom seminars. The electronic seminars (e-seminars) were developed several months prior to start of the epidemiology course for second-year students at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade. The students who applied for e-seminars accessed their content during summer semester (February–May) 2014. E-seminars were set according to the existing topics in practical workbook and designed using Moodle, a free, open-source, personal home page web application for producing modular internet-based courses. To evaluate the motives for enrollment and satisfaction with seminars, two surveys (pre- and post-course) were administered. Students’ exam grades were registered over 4 exam sessions (June–October 2014) and compared according to seminar program. Out of 516 students in the second year, 60 (11.6 %) applied for e-seminars (mean age 21 years). Students considered the reason “It’s easier to do assignments from home” as the strongest motive to participate. When compared to classroom seminars, students in e-seminars had significantly more fun (p = 0.003), thought that e-seminars were better mode to learn epidemiology (p = 0.030) and would recommend them to other colleagues (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in average grade received at the oral exam in epidemiology (t = 0.071, p = 0.944). E-seminars in undergraduate epidemiology course add a novel, easy-to-follow and amusing mode of learning. Based on this pilot study, e-seminars in epidemiology will be available for next generations of students, while further improvement of e-seminars could include expansion of seminar syllabus and development of discussion fora. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study aimed to develop a practical model for predicting students at risk of performing poorly in blended learning courses. Previous research suggests that analyzing usage data stored in the log files of modern Learning Management Systems (LMSs) would allow teachers to develop timely, evidence-based interventions to support at risk or struggling students. The analysis of students' tracking data from a Moodle LMS-supported blended learning course was the focus of this research in an effort to identify significant correlations between different online activities and course grade. Out of 29 LMS usage variables, 14 were found to be significant and were input in a stepwise multivariate regression which revealed that only four variables - Reading and posting messages, Content creation contribution, Quiz efforts and Number of files viewed - predicted 52% of the variance in the final student grade. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study provides updated data on the evolution of Moodle, which was initially seen as an e-learning platform intended to become a pervasive learning environment (PLE) with its multiple possibilities for higher education students and teachers. An online anonymous survey has been administered to a sample of 100 students of different degrees, and 32 teachers of different subject areas to fi nd out their perceptions on the usefulness and improvement of our virtual learning platform at the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC), Spain. Results show that this Learning Management System (LMS) is still regarded as a motivating space to support face-to-face instruction, but it has also been pointed out that it encourages knowledge building, pervasive learning and constructive interaction among its participants.

The aim of the present work was to transfer a wider concept of teamwork and self-learning to the laboratory, encouraging students' capabilities when seeking, acquiring, and processing knowledge. This educational innovation was carried out with a total of 38 students (fourth year of degree in Biology) in the area of physiology (Advances in Reproduction course) at University of Córdoba in Córdoba, Spain. The design of the project's application methodology consisted of establishing a way in which problems would be tackled in the practical classes. For this purpose, the different tasks were set up so that students could relate them to the concepts learned in the theory classes. On the first day of class, the project was presented to the students. Groups of two to three students worked in the laboratory and set up an outline of the protocol of the practical work that they had done. This outline was performed individually and sent to the lecturers through a learning management system (Moodle). The teachers gave feedback and assessed student submissions. Upon finishing the course, students completed a survey. The project-based learning method promotes practical self-learning on the part of students. This methodology demonstrated to us that it stimulates a critical and self-critical capacity in students, both individually and in groups, and that writing didactic practical material helped students to enhance their theory knowledge. The experiment was a success in view of the scores obtained upon finishing the subject. Copyright © 2015 The American Physiological Society.

Objective: To investigate changes in attitudes, resources, and practices of general practitioners (GPs) toward evaluating medical fitness to drive (MFTD) following the publication of national guidelines and an extensive educational programme in traffic medicine. Method: Postal questionnaire survey to GPs (n = 1,000) in November 2013. Results: The final response rate was 46%. GPs are confident (57%) or very confident (14%) in assessing MFTD. There is a high awareness of the new Irish guidelines, with 86% of GPs using them for assistance in assessing MFTD. GPs are divided as to whether GPs (49%) or practitioners specially trained to assess MFTD (44%) should be primarily responsible for assessing MFTD. GPs expressed interest in traffic medicine educational programs, most notably a resource pack for continuous medical education (CME) Small Group learning (87%), MFTD software (71%), and an online moodle (68%). Many (68%) remain concerned about their liability in regard to MFTD assessments. Conclusion: Irish GPs are confident in assessing MFTD and show a high level of awareness of the new guidelines. There is a clear interest among GPs in further educational supports and training in traffic medicine, particularly MFTD assessments. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Web-based labs are key tools for distance education that help to illustrate scientific phenomena, which require costly or difficult-to-assemble equipment. Easy Java Simulations (EJS) is an authoring tool that speeds up the creation of these kind of labs. An excellent proof of the EJS potential is the open source physics (OSP) repository, which hosts hundreds of free EJS labs. Learning management systems, such as Moodle, provide social contexts where students interact with each other. The work described in this paper looks for the synergy of both tools, EJS and Moodle, by supporting the deployment of EJS labs into Moodle and thus enriching them with social features (e.g., chat, forums, and videoconference). To test this approach, the authors have created the ball and beam lab, which helps students of automatic control engineering to train different advanced techniques (robust, fuzzy, and reset control), and compare their performance in relation to a conventional proportional-integral-derivative control. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of LMS users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle LMS users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of HEIs could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the current research study the use of Wikis as an online didactic tool to apply project-based learning in higher education was reported. The study was conducted in university teacher education programmes. During the online activities, participants developed interdisciplinary projects for the primary school working collaboratively in small groups in a Wiki virtual environment within the Moodle platform. Science was at the core of the projects and acted as an organising hub to finding links with other disciplines. A mixed-methods approach involving the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted in the current research study. The authors developed the following three instruments in order to measure both processes and outcomes of the online activities: the interdisciplinary project-based learning questionnaire, the reflection questionnaire and a rubric for assessing interdisciplinary projects. The current paper focuses only on the qualitative data, which were subjected to an inductive content analysis. Results provided evidence of the processes involved during the collaborative activities and that online activities can develop teachers’ abilities to design projects in interdisciplinary contexts. The discussion highlights the aspects of the online environment that made the collaborative work effective in learning. Future implications and suggestions for teacher education programmes are discussed. © 2014 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.

This paper focuses on collaborative learning and educational languages in order to model collaborative instruction. In a previous work, we carried out and tested a collaborative instructional framework (CIF) based on pedagogical goals of the analysis level of Bloom's taxonomy named CIF. Besides, we developed a collaborative tool that supports CIF named mobile collaborative argument support (MoCAS). We conducted experiments in the classroom with students and teachers using CIF and MoCAS and we realized that CIF needed to be improved. Our research goal presented in this paper is to improve CIF to make it support interoperability and portability using educational standards in a learning management systems. Therefore, we present the CIF modeled with intelligent manufacturing system standards using the reload learning design and Moodle tools. © 2013 IEEE.

In this article, we explore the intersecting concepts of fairness, trust and temporality in relation to the implementation of an online peer-to-peer review Moodle Workshop tool at a Sydney metropolitan university. Drawing on qualitative interviews with unit convenors and online surveys of students using the Workshop tool, we seek to highlight a complex array of attitudes, both varied and contested, towards online peer assessment. In particular, we seek to untangle convenors’ positive appraisal of the Workshop tool as a method of encouraging ‘meta-cognitive’ skills, and student perceptions relating to the redistribution of staff marking workload vis-à-vis the peer review tool as ‘unfair’, ‘time-consuming’ and ‘unprofessional’. While the Workshop tool represents an innovative approach to the development of students’ meta-cognitive attributes, the competitive atmosphere that circulates, and is quietly encouraged, within the tertiary education sector limits the true collaborative pedagogical potential and capacities approach built into peer-to-peer review initiatives like the Workshop tool. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The use of e-learning techniques in higher education is becoming ever more frequent. In some institutions, e-learning has completely replaced the traditional teaching methods, while in others it supplements classical courses. The paper presents a study conducted in a member institution of the University of Ljubljana that provides public administration programmes. We analysed the relationship between the proportion of the course implemented in the Moodle e-learning platform and students' performance on one hand and their satisfaction on the other. The empirical findings reveal a positive correlation for both elements. The results can help decision-makers learn more about how to enhance students' success and satisfaction using an e-learning platform. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

The purpose of this research paper is to identify the factors affecting the effectiveness of Moodle from the students' perspective. The research hypotheses derived from the suggested extended Seddon model have been empirically validated using the responses to a survey on e-learning usage among 255 users. We tested the model across higher education institutions in Serbia, Lithuania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. These responses have been examined through partial-least squares. The obtained results strongly support 16 of the 23 research hypotheses for the proposed e-learning model. We defined eight factors (behavioral intention to use in the future, communicativeness, format, information quality, performance outcome, perceived usefulness, satisfaction and system quality) in the initial theoretical e-learning model. Unexpectedly, system and information quality did not influence satisfaction, while communicativeness had the highest significant impact on performance outcome. Satisfaction had a significant effect on behavior intention and accounted for 68.4% of the variance in this area. The findings offer an insight into those factors that are likely significant antecedents for planning and implementing a Moodle e-learning system to enhance student-learning effectiveness. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

In connection with the transition to a two-tier system of training and educational programs development according to the new Federal State Educational Sandards it is necessary to improve measurement and control tools. The article gives special attention to the development of specific diagnostic tests for monitoring competences formation. The main objective of such tests is that the student, performing suggested tasks, is involved into active thinking and is to make informed decisions when problems occur. Their main aim is not to measure the relevant knowledge but to assess his level of understanding and professional thinking. The research work is relevant due to contradiction between the necessity to control the level of different competences formation and insufficient development of techniques for their assessment. The article presents an algorithm for development of tests in foreign languages, taking into account the provisions of the Common European competences. The paper is concerned with the possibilities the learning management system Moodle in the control of competencies formation of bachelor students of the Faculty of Foreign Languages by means of modern facilities. Built-in test system in Moodle provides a great opportunity for creating on-line tests with the following approaches: direct addition of the test in the course, followed by the supplement of test items, and creating new test based on a bank of questions. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between students’ online participation in Moodle and their learning achievement. Participants in the study were 78 undergraduate full-time students who were enrolled in a general education course entitled “Digital Citizenship” at a higher education institute in Hong Kong. They were required to choose from and participate in different types of Moodle activities including information access (e.g., reading online supplementary resources), interactive learning (e.g., running online simulations), networked learning (e.g., discussing in online forums), and materials development (e.g., writing reflective journals). The online participation of a student was measured by the number of completed activities, while the learning achievement of a student was determined by his/her essay grade. This study applied the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method to the collected data in order to identify whether there was a link between online participation and learning achievement. The results indicate that online participation in networked learning or in materials development, but not in information access nor in interactive learning, was positively and significantly related to learning achievement. This finding highlights the importance of social interaction and individual constructivism for effective online learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

Purpose: To subjectively and objectively compare an accessible interactive electronic library using Moodle with lectures for urology teaching of medical students. Methods: Forty consecutive fourth-year medical students and one urology teacher were exposed to two teaching methods (4 weeks each) in the form of problem-based learning: - lectures and - student-centered group discussion based on Moodle (modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment) full time online delivered (24/7) with video surgeries, electronic urology cases and additional basic principles of the disease process. Results: All 40 students completed the study. While 30% were moderately dissatisfied with their current knowledge base, online learning course delivery using Moodle was considered superior to the lectures by 86% of the students. The study found the following observations: (1) the increment in learning grades ranged from 7.0 to 9.7 for students in the online Moodle course compared to 4.0-9.6 to didactic lectures; (2) the self-reported student involvement in the online course was characterized as large by over 60%; (3) the teacher-student interaction was described as very frequent (50%) and moderately frequent (50%); and (4) more inquiries and requisitions by students as well as peer assisting were observed from the students using the Moodle platform. Conclusions: The Moodle platform is feasible and effective, enthusing medical students to learn, improving immersion in the urology clinical rotation and encouraging the spontaneous peer assisted learning. Future studies should expand objective evaluations of knowledge acquisition and retention. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the past decades, online learning has transformed the educational landscape with the emergence of new ways to learn. This fact, together with recent changes in educational policy in Europe aiming to facilitate the incorporation of graduate students to the labor market, has provoked a shift on the delivery of instruction and on the role played by teachers and students, stressing the need for development of both basic and cross-curricular competencies. In parallel, the last years have witnessed the emergence of new educational disciplines that can take advantage of the information retrieved by technology-based online education in order to improve instruction, such as learning analytics. This study explores the applicability of learning analytics for prediction of development of two cross-curricular competencies - teamwork and commitment - based on the analysis of Moodle interaction data logs in a Master's Degree program at Universidad a Distancia de Madrid (UDIMA) where the students were education professionals. The results from the study question the suitability of a general interaction-based approach and show no relation between online activity indicators and teamwork and commitment acquisition. The discussion of results includes multiple recommendations for further research on this topic. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The authentication of students in E-learning is relevant to verify the assessment of distance learning students. Among diverse technologies for recognition, facial authentication (by means of biometrics) allows user identities to be corroborated and certified focusing on their facial physiological characteristics. The demand of students wishing to achieve admission to E-learning programs is actually high. Subsequently, it is essential for this type of education to be as respectable and recognised as any other. For this purpose, it would be essential to check the students' identities while doing their homework using learning management systems such as Moodle platform. The main objective of this study is the analysis of student impressions concerning the development and implementation of facial verification for E-learning within the Moodle platform in different Spanish speaking areas like Spain and Latin America. A survey was carried out among the students after using the facial authentication tool within Moodle. The survey of 67 students from Masters produced high satisfaction scores about the acceptance of facial authentication as an improvement technique for distance education. Nevertheless, in general Spanish students reached lower average levels compared to Latin American students. These differences are statistically analysed to show their significance. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

e-Assessment provides solutions to some problems encountered in dental students' evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of a limited-resources dental school with e-assessment provided through an open-source learning management system (LMS). Data about users' access and types of e-assessment activities at the Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University, Egypt, were obtained from the web-based LMS Moodle. A questionnaire developed to assess students' perceptions of the e-assessment was also sent to students registered in two courses (undergraduate and postgraduate) with the same instructor. The results showed that most e-courses at the school had one form of e-assessment (82%) and, of these, 16.7% had summative assessment activities. There were significant differences among departments in the number of e-courses with e-assessment. One-quarter of e-courses with e-assessment used Moodle quizzes. Of 285 students registered in the two courses that included the questionnaire, 170 responded (response rate=59.6%). The responding students positively perceived the impact of e-assessment on learning and its reliability and security, whereas technical issues and related stresses were negatively perceived. This study suggests that e-assessment can be used at minimal cost in dental schools with limited resources and large class sizes with the least demands on faculty members and teaching staff time. For these schools, an open-source LMS such as Moodle provides formative e-assessment not available otherwise and accommodates various question formats and varying levels of instructors' technical skills. These students seemed to have a positive impression of the e-assessment although technical problems and related stresses are issues that need to be addressed.

Background E-learning is the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to provide online education and learning. E- Learning has now been integrated into the traditional teaching as the concept of ‘blended learning’ that combines digital learning with the existing traditional teaching methods to address the various challenges in the field of medical education. Structured e-learning activities were started in Melaka Manipal Medical College in 2009 via e-learning platform (MOODLE-Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). Objectives The objective of the present study is to investigate the faculty opinions toward the existing e-learning activities, and to analyse the extent of adopting and integration of e-learning into their traditional teaching methods. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among faculties of Medicine and Dentistry using pre-tested questionnaires. The data was analyzed by using the statistical package for social science, SPSS, version 16.0. Results The result of our survey indicates that majority of our faculty (65.4%) held positive opinion towards e-learning. Among the few, who demonstrated reservations, it is attributed to their average level of skills and aptitude in the use of computers that was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study brings to light the need for formal training as perquisite to support e-learning that enables smooth transition of the faculty from their traditional teaching methods into blended approach. Our results are anticipated to strengthen the existing e-learning activities of our college and other universities and convincingly adopt e-learning as a viable teaching and learning strategy. © 2015, Kathmandu University.

This study was undertaken to examine the influence that a set of Professional Development (PD) initiatives had on faculty use of Moodle, a well-known Course Management System. The context of the study was a private university in Japan that specializes in languages. Specifically, it aimed to identify the way in which the pd initiatives adhered to professional development best practice criteria, and what impact the pd initiatives had on faculty use of Moodle. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach. Participants in the study were 42 teachers who worked at the university. The results indicated that the pd initiatives adhered closely to criteria posited in technology-related professional development best practice criteria. Further, results from the online survey and follow up face-to-face interviews indicated that while the pd initiatives that were implemented were positively perceived by faculty, they did not have the anticipated impact on Moodle use. © 2015 JALT CALL SIG.

In New Zealand schools, the adoption and persistent use of digital tools to aid learning is a growing but uneven, trend, often linked to the practices of early adopters and/or robust wifi infrastructure. The Technology Adoption Model is used internationally to gauge levels of uptake of technological tools, particularly in commerce and also in education. However, this model is inadequate when it is used to attribute reasons for teachers adopting technologies for learning. This article offers an alternative view to understanding why teachers continue using digital technologies for learning. It focuses on the role of student voice and teachers' pedagogical purposes as motivators, even when teachers have technological hurdles to overcome. The article engages with continuance theory as a lens for understanding these motivations via a qualitative thematic analysis of Moodle postings made by a 2012 cohort of initial teacher education students. The intention is to signpost ideas that might better explain teachers continued use of digital technologies in classrooms even if conditions for use are not optimal. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The study discusses the conditions for the implementation of practical orientation increase for future teachers preparation through the integration of interactive technologies in the learning process. It is suggested that the organization of training on the basis of the proposed mechanisms of distance learning platform for the integration of interactive technologies enhances the practical orientation among the bachelors with teacher education. The theoretical bases of interactivity integration into the educational process are determined. The types of interactive cooperation within the distant learning are determined between the participants of educational environment: a student, a teacher, a group of students, an interactive content. The sequence of student actions is described using interactive teaching methods and the distance learning course, created on the platform of distance learning system. The main advantages of such a training organization which motivates students are specified. In accordance with the possibilities of a distance learning course of the system moodle, the types of activities are described undertaken by a teacher and a student. The analysis of interactive learning opportunities and realization terms of distance learning system moodle for their support allows to describe the components of the mechanism, the ways of their implementation, the examples of applications in different types of a student educational activity.

Nowadays, one of the key challenges for distance education is to be able to verify the students’ identity in order to check if they are actually who they claim to be when they are doing their online tasks and to avoid identity thief. This can be achieved through facial authentication software. In e-learning, thanks to this technology there is a way to confirm that the students are not committing fraud in their studies and besides to improve this kind of education by equaling its validity and prestige to traditional face-to-face education. The goal of this research is to avoid fake users that perform educational tasks on behalf of others in the Learning Management Systems (LMSs), and more specifically to develop a new technique to design activities with glossaries that properly allow control of the student learning process through facial authentication software. The presented technique is composed of several steps that guide instructors in the elaboration of this kind of activities. This work has used Moodle platform for the experimentation, and analyzes the experience of 67 students with the activities designed with the presented technique. © 2015, Giunti. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we are interested in the transformation of a face-to-face active course into a web-based active course. Indeed, distance education has been rapidly become more important around the world due to the development of Information and Communication Technology. However, the roles of these later must evolve to accommodate these new models, with increased student responsibility and accountability. First, we reports on the experience of Constantine1 University in the development of 'Electric oscillator circuit' on-line course via the Moodle platform. We describe the different stages of the online course and highlight its possibility, which is not available in the face-to-face courses. Second, we present the remote lab of UC1 University, which is developed under eSience project. It aims to develop remote labs in the Maghreb country and to link them. Therefore, we focus on the implementation of 'Wien Bridge Oscillator' experiment, which is deployed on the interactive version of iLab Shared Architecture (ISA).

Teacher education is constantly being renewed in response to continuous social, economic and technological changes. In 2008, teacher education in Iceland was extended from a three-year to a five-year master's degree program and this significantly increased the number of students at the master's level. To respond to these changes, 3 university-based teacher educators organized collaborative supervisory meetings for 18 master's students during the school years 2012–2014. We used self-study methodology to analyze our progress and inspire our development as supervisors. The goal was to gain a better understanding of how we learn together in collaborative supervision and to develop, adapt, and change our teaching and learning practices. Data included reflective notes and journals, recordings of students' and supervisors' meetings, e-mails, tickets out of class, and material from Moodle. Constant analysis of data was conducted with personal reflection and collective discussion, using theories to scrutinize data. Our findings show that, by working together on supervisory issues, we expanded our resources, strengthened our collaboration and trust, developed our professional identities, and improved our collective supervisory efficacy. We discovered that self-study provided an in-between space for us to explore cultures, roles, and visions as we collaboratively contested, defined and recreated our roles as supervisors. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Online forums represent nowadays one of the most popular and rich repository of user generated information over the Internet. Searching information of interest in an online forum may be substantially improved by a proper organization of the forum content. With this aim, in this paper we propose an approach that enhances an existing forum by introducing a navigation structure that enables searching and navigating the forum content by topics of discussion. Topics and hierarchical relations between them are semi-automatically extracted from the forum content by applying Information Retrieval techniques, specifically Topic Models and Formal Concept Analysis. Then, forum posts and discussion threads are associated to discussion topics on a similarity score basis. Moreover, to support automatic moderation in websites that host several forums, we propose a strategy to assist a user writing a new post in choosing the most appropriate forum into which it should be added. An implementation of the topic-driven content search and navigation and assisted posting forum enhancement approaches for the Moodle learning management system is also presented in the paper, opening to the application of these approaches to several real distance learning contexts. Finally, we also report on two case studies that we have conducted to validate the two approaches and evaluate their benefits. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Objective: to identify the contribution made by a refresher course on the assessment of chronic wounds, offered through the Moodle virtual learning environment (VLE), to the knowledge relating to this issue of nursing lecturers and nurses linked to higher education. Method: a prospective, quasi-experimental study, with data collection before and after the educational intervention. The study was undertaken in three stages using the Moodle VLE. The sample was made up of 28 participants who answered the pre-test on the knowledge, devised in accordance with international guidelines on chronic wounds. Afterwards, the refresher course was offered (intervention) and was accessed in accordance with individuals’ schedules, during the established time period. At the end of the course, 26 participants answered the post-test. Those who did not participate in the post-tests were excluded from the study, as it is pairwise analysis of the sample. Result: the participants obtained, on average, 55.5% of correct answers in the pre-test on their knowledge, and 73.4% in the post-test, this difference being statistically significant. There was a negative correlation between the time of experience in lecturing and the performance in the test on their knowledge. Conclusion: the participation in the online refresher course contributed to improving the lecturers’ performance in the test on their knowledge, in relation to the recommendations for assessing chronic wounds, based in scientific evidence. © 2015 Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem.

Online learning communities are frequently created for higher education students; however, these are most often designed to cater to a particular unit or subject. In an effort to strengthen the Bachelor of Arts course at the University of New England, the author sought to create an online space that would promote an interdisciplinary and collegial dialogue among their broad on- and off-campus student cohort. This paper examines the building of an academic community among a large and diverse group of undergraduate students on a Moodle platform. The paper tracks the development of the multi-layered portal from the initial stages of planning to the indicators of strong engagement taken up by students, and eventually leading to the creation of similar portals across the university. In examining this process this paper highlights the shared desire by distance education students and academics for authentic and personal higher education participation regardless of the students’ location. © 2015, © 2015 Open and Distance Learning Association of Australia, Inc.

Growth in student numbers and heavy teaching workloads may negatively influence the quality of teaching and learning in higher education. Various strategies have been introduced to try and address these concerns. One specific strategy involves the use of learning management systems to enhance the interaction between students and academics. The purpose of this article is to highlight student usage of a learning management system in electrical engineering at an open distance learning institute in South Africa, correlating it to the student's academic achievement. The lack of 100% student engagement suggests that not all students have access to the Internet. A relationship was established between the pass rates of the modules and the student usage of the learning management system and student support given via the learning management system. Final grade results suggest that students who fully engaged with the learning management system are more likely to succeed in an open distance learning environment. © 2015 The Author(s).

The concept of social presence proposed in studies on communities of inquiry has highlighted both the importance and the challenges of integrating aspects such as affective and relational expressions among team members while solving collaborative learning tasks, in order to advance in a global comprehension of learning processes. This paper presents a theoretical and methodological proposal for tackling this issue from a socio-cultural perspective by analysing the participants’ discourse in relation to expressions of selfcompetence (at an individual and group level) concerning the task and group cohesion (task cohesion and social cohesion). This proposal’s potential is illustrated by the empirical results of a case study that analyses social presence during a collaborative work task by university students using the Moodle learning platform. © 2015 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

In spite of the advances in technology in the e-learning field during the last decades, there is still a gap of software and tools that actually improve the assessment of this kind of education by preventing students from cheating when they perform their activities online. Currently, most learning management systems do not offer enough tools or characteristics to check that students are who they assure when they carry out their exercises or online tests. Facial verification software can be considered an interesting tool to answer this need. This facial software helps to verify the identity of the students when they perform their activities, with the intention of confirming whether they are who they claim to be. However, its use could modify the academic results of the students due to psychological factors (e.g., they could feel spied, ashamed or too controlled). The aim of this article is to investigate whether the utilization of facial verification software can modify the academic performance of students in their online activities. In this work, the grades of 70 master students were analyzed and the conclusions pointed out that the academic performance obtained by the students is similar for both groups: those who have used facial authentication and those who did not use it. © 2015 TEMPUS Publications.

The integration of different platforms in the academic environment is a challenge within the field of information technology. In the field of e-learning, where learning management systems are used for courses development, their integration with other platforms and applications is interesting, in particular with digital repositories. This article describes the integration of Moodle with the DSpace repository. The integration process consists of two stages, in order to establish full communication to and from the repository. For communication from Moodle to the repository, with the goal of consulting and transferring elements from DSpace, modules already implemented were used. The current stage is implementing a specific module in order to establish communication in the other direction and allow transferring resources from the LMS to the repository. This module is very useful for educational material that can be made publicly available through a repository and thus transcending the borders of an educational environment.

Current-generation assessment tools used in K-12 and post-secondary education are limited in the type of questions they support; this limitation makes it difficult for instructors to navigate their assessment engines. Furthermore, the question types tend to score low on Bloom's Taxonomy. Dedicated learning management systems (LMS) such as Blackboard, Moodle and Canvas are somewhat better than informal tools as they offer more question types and some randomization. Still, question types in all the major LMS assessment engines are limited. Additionally, LMSs place a heavy burden on teachers to generate online assessments. In this study we analyzed the top three LMS providers to identify inefficiencies. These inefficiencies in LMS design, point us to ways to ask better questions. Our findings show that teachers have not adopted current tools because they do not offer definitive improvements in productivity. Therefore, we developed LiquiZ, a design for a next-generation assessment engine that reduces user effort and provides more advanced question types that allow teachers to ask questions that can currently only be asked in one-on-one demonstration. The initial LiquiZ project is targeted toward STEM subjects, so the question types are particularly advantageous in math or science subjects. © 2015 by the authors.

In engineering, remote laboratories present a triple role: they provide to the students the necessary contact with real devices, introduce them in the use of new technologies and make possible that the students conduct lab classes when and where they want. In this paper we present a remote lab devoted to photovoltaic power. The experimental system consists of two photovoltaic panels connected to a variable load and illuminated by a variable luminary. It allows the students to obtain different characteristic curves. The user interface has been integrated in Moodle. The system access management is carried out by software developed by authors. A didactic valuation process has been carried out to establish the acceptation of the educational experience by the students and to identify underlying factors. The hardware and software developed for this remote lab are not specific, but reusable for other remote lab experiences besides the one presented here. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The article discusses the problems of using web technologies in the development of self-sufficiency of University students. We hypothesize that real professional situations in which he/she is obliged to work independently on the basis of web technologies contribute to the development of students' self-sufficiency. It is shown that the activity approach to learning, based on the use of project learning technologies in the process of preparing for lessons by learners and interactive technologies of blended learning, promotes the development of independence and self-reliance of students on the basis of web technologies. This article contains a matrix of integration of interactive technologies in the process of independent work of students. This will allow the teacher to select the tools for Moodle Leaning Management System in order to successfully implement the interactive forms and education methods in independent work of students in the conditions of turning down the monologue-based oral presentation of training material by the teacher. For assessment of the effectiveness results of research we carried out a survey of Bachelors of pedagogical education. The article presents the results of the survey of four-year students confirming the results of the study. © the author(s).

Students' understanding of probability concepts have been investigated from various different perspectives. This study was set out to investigate perceived understanding of probability concepts of forty-four students from the STAT131 Understanding Uncertainty and Variation course at the University of Wollongong, NSW. Rasch measurement which is based on a probabilistic model was used to identify concepts that students find easy, moderate and difficult to understand. Data were captured from the e-learning Moodle platform where students provided their responses through an on-line quiz. As illustrated in the Rasch map, 96% of the students could understand about sample space, simple events, mutually exclusive events and tree diagram while 67% of the students found concepts of conditional and independent events rather easy to understand. © 2015 Journal on Mathematics Education.All rights reserved.

This chapter introduces the concept of adding a fuzzy logic classifier to e-Learning framework. This conceptual model uses Fuzzy Logic Evaluation Sub-systems (FLESs) to implement “Theory of probability” curriculum. The customized sub-system is used to dynamically evaluate student knowledge. It is essential that the FLES-PRobabilty (FLES-PR) capture’s the students’ interest to maintain their motivation and increase the effectiveness of the learning experience. Given that interactive systems increase the education efficiency and the individual abilities of student, the routine actions of teacher are must be delegated to e-Learning system. In this chapter, artificial intelligence concepts, techniques, and technologies are used to deliver the e-Learning requirements. For instance, a fuzzy logic scheme is created to evaluate student knowledge when using the FLES-PR. The curriculum is delivered using two FLES modules instantiated using the “Matlab” 6.5 fuzzy toolbox environment. Each sub-system provides structured lessons, representing topics, content, and additional contextual parameters. The FLES is designed to gain the students attention, highlights the lesson objective(s), stimulates recall of prior knowledge, and progressively elicits new material to guide increased performance by providing feedback using benign assessment to enhance retention. The proposed evaluation system is designed as a functioning plug-into the universities “Moodle” server to leverage from the existing course management, learning management and virtual learning environment. It also recommends the pace and complexity of learning as the student progresses through the curriculum. This chapter case study discusses the success of the FLES-PR software tool and explains how it has been validated against the manual results of three human experts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

This study investigated the effect of scaffolding computer-mediated discussions to improve moral reasoning and argumentation quality in pre-service teachers. Participants of this study were 76 teaching education students at a Turkish university. They were divided into three groups: (1) a computer-supported argumentation group; (2) a computer-mediated discussion group; and (3) a control group. Participants in the computer-supported argumentation group were instructed in argumentation, and were provided with note starters and graphical argumentation tools. The computer-mediated discussion group, however, was engaged in unstructured interaction on the Moodle forum, a free popular learning management system having a threaded discussion forum. The control group did not receive any instruction and neither did they participate in any discussions. As for the results, the computer-supported argumentation group outperformed the control group, but not the computer-mediated discussion group on DIT score and argumentation quality. Thus, it was concluded that both giving instruction on argumentation and appropriately designing the interfaces of computer-mediated discussion environments can enhance argumentation quality in students’ writings and also their moral reasoning. © 2015 Journal of Moral Education Ltd.

The flipped classroom is a new teaching model that is highly advocated for the teaching reform of colleges and universities in China. To make the student the real learning subject and enhance the teacher's guiding role in effective teaching, the authors propose a flipped classroom model that integrates learning, guidance, practice and application. Moodle was used in this research, to form an integrated platform to cover the entire process of before-class, in-class and after-class teaching that integrates teaching, guidance, practice and application. With an example course on Sensors and Detection Technology, a corresponding teaching model was designed. The results show that flipped classroom teaching enhanced the learning performance of students, stimulated their learning motivation and improved their creativity. Therefore, the flipped classroom teaching model can be used effectively in teaching engineering courses at colleges and universities. © 2015 WIETE.

With the development of e-education and e-society it is important for information and communication systems and services to be equally accessible to all users, including people with disabilities. Learning management systems (LMSs) are becoming a necessity in higher education and making them accessible to all users, both students and teachers, is crucial. Existing studies on accessibility of LMSs mostly focus on students and their access to learning materials. Very few studies have focused on the accessibility of LMSs for teachers who are responsible for using LMSs to create accessible contents for students. This paper presents the heuristic evaluations of two learning management systems (Fronter and Sakai) focusing on their accessibility from teachers' perspective. Based on universal design principles and guidelines we aim to identify accessibility issues and to propose possible improvements. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 were adopted in the heuristic evaluations and qualitative data have been collected. We have also compared the findings from the evaluations of Fronter and Sakai, as well as Moodle, an open source LMS which was evaluated in our previous heuristic evaluation. The analysis of the data shows that the level of conformance of the systems to the ATAG2.0 guidelines is very low and many issues needs to be solved for them to be fully accessible for teachers with disabilities.

Prior research on learning management system (LMS) continuance focused on either the perspective of educators or that of students. Such studies fall short in advising customised intervention plans based on the user type. This paper investigates perceptions of both educators and students, and tests the moderating role of user type (educators vs. students) in determining the satisfaction and continued use of the LMS. We adopted the information systems (IS) continuance model extended with ease of use and placed user type as a moderator. We test the model by collecting data from 170 educators and 233 students in a Finnish university who use a popular LMS, Moodle. Partial least squares (PLS) technique is employed to test the possible moderation effects. The PLS analysis results revealed that user type moderates most of the relationships in the extended IS continuance model such that the relationships are stronger for students than educators. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

This article presents a research study addressing the development, implementation, evaluation, and use of Interactive Modules for Online Training (MITO) of mathematics in higher education. This work was carried out in the context of the MITO project, which combined several features of the learning and management system Moodle, the computer-aided assessment for mathematics STACK, the mathematical software GeoGebra, several packages from the type-setting program LaTeX, and tutorial videos. A total of 1,962 students participated in this study. Two groups of students taking a calculus course were selected for a deeper analysis. With regard to usability and functionality, the results indicate that MITO scored well in almost all aspects, which is fundamental for their introduction into formal university courses. The analysis of the data reveals that the use of MITO educational contents by students mainly occurs about 1 week and a half prior to the evaluations. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the results of online assessments on MITO in a continuous assessment model and the final grade on the course. © The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

Currently, there are a variety of digital resources hosted on the Internet, based on access points such as digital libraries and repositories. The majority of strategies to store information are used by specialized documentation centers, academic institutions, and databases of regional development policies. These entities have been directing their efforts to improve the access over a collection of digital resources for academic and professional purposes. There is still a lot of educational material that is hosted on content management tools known as Learning Content Management System (LCMS); however, those tools do not perform the corresponding indexing of digital resources for the use of repositories. In fact, this requirement reduces the access to digital resources even from the inside of each academic institution, losing coverage and recognition in other learning environments. Moreover, this factor also limits the enrichment and linking of related academic material. Then, strategies such as Linked Data cannot be extensively used to share digital resources. Therefore, this article aims to devise an indexing strategy to manage digital resources hosted in different LCMS by defining services that facilitate the exchange of digital resources and their reuse.

With the transition to a bachelor degree the training time reduced and the number of disciplines was not decreased, so the emphasis is on independent work of students to maintain the level of student preparation. The urgency of the problem stated in the study is conditioned by the fact that at the traditional form of independent student work organization in mathematics there are difficulties in the study of this discipline, the lack of study sources of information, etc. So, one needs to organize an independent work properly and efficiently through information technologies. The purpose of the study is to develop methods of using information technology in the organization of independent work of students. The leading method in the study of this problem is a design method aimed at the selection and structuring of electronic educational resource content on the subject "Mathematics" in Moodle environment. The developed electronic educational resource for the students of non-mathematical professions includes the following topics: the elements of linear algebra, analytic geometry, mathematical analysis and differential equations. The created electronic educational resource is aimed at the improvement of student knowledge on mathematics and promotes the development of self-employment among students. An experimental study was conducted in 2013-2014, on the basis of biological department at Elabuzhsky Institute of Kazan (Volga region) Federal University. The students of the following areas of training took part in this study: 06.03.01 Biology, "General Biology" profile and 44.03.05.

MOOCs are a recent phenomenon, although given their impact, they have been subject to a large debate. Several questions have been raised by researchers and educators alike regarding their sustainability, both economically and as an efficient mode of education provision. In this paper we contribute to this discussion by presenting a case study of the MOOC on Lived Experiences of Climate Change, which piloted the iMOOC pedagogical model developed at Universidade Aberta (UAb), the Portugese Distance Learning University. The iMOOC is a hybrid model which incorporates elements from existing MOOCs but adds other features drawn from UAb's experience with online learning and aims at better integrating in the larger context of the institutional pedagogical culture. The iMOOC implied also an integration of platforms - Moodle and Elgg. The pilot course had more than one thousand registrations, and it was the largest MOOC course on Portuguese language delivered so far. We discuss the effort required to design and deliver the course, the technological solution developed, and the results obtained. We registered a moderate effort to create and run the course, ensured by internal staff from the University. The technological solution was a success: an integrated architecture combining well-established, well-tested open software. The completion rate was 3.3%, but the high success of this innovative learning experience was demonstrated by the active involvement of about 50% of the registered participants, that followed the course until the end. Lessons learned from this experience and future research on the field are also discussed.

Introduction: Developments in technology, web-based teaching and whole slide imaging have broadened the teaching horizon in anatomic pathology. Creating online learning material including many types of media such as radiologic images, whole slides, videos, clinical and macroscopic photographs, is now accessible to most universities. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor to maintain and update the learning material is the amount of resources needed. In this perspective, a French-national university network was initiated in 2011 to build joint online teaching modules consisting of clinical cases and tests. The network has since expanded internationally to Québec, Switzerland and Ivory Coast. Method: One of the first steps of the project was to build a learning module on inflammatory skin pathology for interns and residents in pathology and dermatology. A pathology resident from Québec spent 6 weeks in France and Switzerland to develop the contents and build the module on an e-learning Moodle platform under the supervision of two dermatopathologists. The learning module contains text, interactive clinical cases, tests with feedback, virtual slides, images and clinical photographs. For that module, the virtual slides are decentralized in 2 universities (Bordeaux and Paris 7). Each university is responsible of its own slide scanning, image storage and online display with virtual slide viewers. Results: The module on inflammatory skin pathology includes more than 50 web pages with French original content, tests and clinical cases, links to over 45 virtual images and more than 50 microscopic and clinical photographs. The whole learning module is being revised by four dermatopathologists and two senior pathologists. It will be accessible to interns and residents in the spring of 2014. The experience and knowledge gained from that work will be transferred to the next international resident whose work will be aimed at creating lung and breast pathology learning modules. Conclusion: The challenges of sustaining a project of this scope are numerous. The technical aspect of whole-slide imaging and storage needs to be developed by each university or group. The content needs to be regularly updated and its accuracy reviewed by experts in each individual domain. The learning modules also need to be promoted within the academic community to ensure maximal benefit for trainees. A collateral benefit of the project was the establishment of international partnerships between French-speaking universities and pathologists with the common goal of promoting pathology education through the use of multi-media technology including whole slide imaging. © Perron et al.

In this article, we attempt to investigate the affordances of e-leaming in supporting tertiary teaching and learning. Using an interpretive qualitative study, we analyzed a total of 46 students from three different programme, namely Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics education through questionnaires and interviews. The findings revealed that students' views were generally positive towards the technical aspects based on technology and tools used in the e-learning environment, the pedagogical aspects of e-learning approach involved, and the social aspects of e-learning environment. However, while e-learning environment can help students to learn from one another in the class, it requires preparation in terms of technology and tools, collaborative learning tasks, and collaborative learning approach. Thus, this article also offers practical suggestions for implementing teaching and learning with e-learning within a tertiary classroom. © 2014 International Information Institute.

Objectives. The main objectives were to assess medical students’ opinions about e-learning in psychiatry undergraduate medical education, and to investigate a possible relationship between learning styles and preferences for learning modalities. Method. During the academic year 2009/2010, all 231 senior Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) medical students in their penultimate year of study were invited to answer a questionnaire that was posted online on Moodle, the RCSI virtual learning environment. Results. In all, 186 students responded to the questionnaire, a response rate of 80%. Significantly more students stated a preference for live psychiatry tutorials over e-learning lectures. Students considered flexible learning, having the option of viewing material again and the ability to learn at one’s own pace with e-learning lectures, to be more valuable than having faster and easier information retrieval. Conclusion. Students prefer traditional in-class studying, even when they are offered a rich e-learning environment. Understanding students’ learning styles has been identified as an important element for e-learning development, delivery and instruction, which can lead to improved student performance. © College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2014.

Learning teaching in cyberspace is becoming more and more widespread in the current teacher education framework, due to a growing need to enhance the quality of practical training and the presence of information and communication technologies in all spheres of life. Thus, e-training, defined here as supplementing teacher development with online interactions in the virtual space, is proposed as an option for enhancing practical training of foreign language teachers. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the process of extending practical training with the use of e-learning in two models, online interactions among trainees (local connections) and intercultural teacher training tandems (global connections). After the literature review into the use of ICT and e-learning in teacher development, both models will be elaborated upon.

This paper focuses on the fora of asynchronous distance education with the purpose of comparing educational techniques widely used in the fields (such as brainstorming and snowballing) in a combined environment both via computer and mobile devices, in the framework of a training program in IT basic skills for primary education teachers. For the purpose of this study, modelling in formal language was used to classify the messages in the Moodle forum (V.1.6) as well as a respective system to automate this procedure. As it is deduced from the data analysis and the study of the text messages in the Moodle forum (V.1.6), the groups using brainstorming technique show higher participation at the forum than those using the snowballing technique. Furthermore, the brainstorming technique is more advantageous than the Snowballing technique concerning the educational effectiveness. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Many educators are gravitating towards the use of learning management systems (LMSs), such as Blackboard, Daedalus Interchange, and Moodle, for managing courses and enhancing student learning. There is thus a growing need to examine second language (L2) learners' academic socialization through their participation in computer-mediated academic literacy practices. By employing a community of practice perspective, the present study was an attempt to demonstrate how learning management systems mediate L2 learners' academic discourse socialization and is closely related to issues of identities and learner agency. The study presented here contributes to the growing body of e-learning research to illustrate and explain the complex and dynamic ways that non-native novice students negotiated their academic participation in their graduate class. © 2014 SERSC.

Background: The use of the Internet as a teaching medium has increased rapidly over the last decade. PLATO (postgraduate learning and teaching online) was launched in 2008 by the e-learning unit (ELU) of Wales Deanery. Located within Learning@NHSWales, a Moodle virtual learning environment (VLE), it hosts a wide range of freely available courses and resources tailored to support the education, training and continuing professional development (CPD) needs of health care professionals working across the National Health Service (NHS) Wales. The evaluation aimed to identify the costs and benefits of PLATO, report its value as attributed by users, identify potential cost savings and make recommendations. Methods: Five courses (case studies) were selected, representing the range of available e-learning resources: e-induction; fetal heart monitoring; cervical screening; GP prospective trainers; and tools for trainers. Mixed methods were used: one-to-one qualitative interviews, focus group discussions and surveys explored user views, and identified individual and organisational value. Results: Qualitative findings identified six key areas of value for users: ELU support and guidance; avoidance of duplication and standardisation; central reference; local control; flexibility for learners; and specific features. Survey results (n=72) indicated 72percent of consultants reported that PLATO was easy to access and user friendly. E-learning was rated as 'very/important' for CPD by 79percent of respondents. Key challenges were: access, navigation, user concerns, awareness and support. Discussion: PLATO supports education and helps deliver UK General Medical Council standards. Future plans should address the suggested recommendations to realise cost savings for NHS Wales and the Wales Deanery. The findings have wider applicability to others developing or using VLEs. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Mobile devices are everywhere to be found on university campuses. This has changed the nature of higher education and led to a new mobile form of e-learning known as m-learning.The aim of this article is to assess the penetration of mobile devices for learning purposes in higher education and to identify the main usage patterns. To that end, the study used two complementary methodologies: web usage mining and a questionnaire survey. Web usage mining was performed to collect data from the university's learning management system (LMS) in order to explore this new technology's usage trends in the past four academic years and to identify the main patterns of behaviour. A questionnaire survey of 460 university students was conducted to find out about the student-declared level of m-learning penetration. The results are conclusive: 25% of accesses to the LMS were made from mobile devices and 75% of the students used these devices for learning purposes. The findings of this study have significant implications not only for researchers and lecturers, but also for institutions intending to implement this teaching/learning methodology. © 2014 by FUOC.

This article presents a techno-pedagogical lecturer training model that was validated in an intensive hybrid-mode workshop/course for lecturers. The aim of the course was to train lecturers how to use the Moodle virtual learning environment (VLE) as a didactic support in their classrooms. A research-action method was applied to the study, and the instruments used were interviews, questionnaires, blogs and opinion surveys, together with the planning and development of an online course by each participant as the end-product. The course was then analysed to see how each of the 16 participants had gradually appropriated the technology, without overlooking the pedagogical aspects. Some progressed from beginner to intermediate level, and others from intermediate to advanced level, while those already at advanced level developed sophisticated courses and sought ways of improving them on their own. In addition, the researchers found that the role of the university institution had been fundamental to the proper running of the course, and that constant communication between the facilitator and the lecturers/learners had been important. © 2014 by FUOC.

Wiki is a tool to support collaborative works between learners. Wiki also has proven to provide an efficient, flexible, user friendly and cost effective interface for collaboration, knowledge creation and archive, and learner interaction. Current research finding stated that wiki is an e-learning tool which is very less in terms of use among instructors and learners. Moreover, the learning community is not aware with the capability of wiki to support interactive learning environment as well as effective for their knowledge, skills and attitude. Therefore, this paper highlights the initiative to use wiki in Moodle 2.3 for knowledge construction. The analyses usage of wiki have been done by observing the wiki Moodle data log and survey of learners’ usage in Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The result of analysis is able to determine the active and passive attitude among learners. In addition, to identify the effectiveness of knowledge construction by using wiki towards learners’ knowledge, skills and attitude. Finally, this result guides instructors to improve learning strategies on wiki and motivates learners to enhance their knowledge construction learning method. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

The agricultural education covers all levels of formal education but focuses mostly on the higher ones as well as the vocational education and training. Online courses play an important role in the educational context and compared to traditional courses they eliminate the location and time restrictions and allow a self-paced attendance of a curriculum. At the same time, the existence of online courses raised the need for the design and implementation of the appropriate platforms which may be used for the organization and deployment of online courses. This paper presents the case of agriMoodle, a course management platform based on the widely used Moodle platform, which provides a number of enhancements in the form of modules or widgets specialized for the agricultural domain. These modules aim to enhance the user experience and the functionalities of a standard Moodle installation.

A destructive earthquake happened in October 2011 in one of the cities at Eastern Region of our country and it caused big damages in the city. All educational system affected negatively and university in the city had to break down its education. It was even not possible to continue education because of huge damages and heavy weather condition at city. In order to solve this problem, it was decided to use Moodle to continue education at the university. All students and instructors except for the medical and dental faculties were obliged to use Moodle during 2011-2012 fall semesters. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the factors which might affect the intention to use Moodle by university students using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in case of earthquake. A survey method was used to collect data. Purposive sampling was used and 501 university students were participated in the current study. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and the proposed model was tested by using structural equation model. The proposed model has seven constructs and nine hypotheses have been generated from the connections among these seven constructs. Except for the one hypothesis, the model supported the entire hypothesis proposed in the model. Implications and discussion are made in light of the results. © 2014, Hacettepe University.

Purpose: Many universities are in the process of changing their learning management systems to Moodle yet there is limited empirical research available on the impact of this change. The purpose of this paper is to explore the results of an initial pilot, which was conducted as the first stage of implementing Moodle at an Australian university. Design/methodology/approach: The pilot study involved an online survey and a focus group with unit convenors teaching Open University Australia (OUA) units in Moodle. Findings: The aim was to essentially test Moodle and eliminate any technological issues prior to the university-wide roll-out the following year. It was envisaged that this pilot would contribute to building capability and knowledge amongst staff members; however, it was unanticipated that this would be jeopardised by a wider and ongoing issue in higher education; namely, the casualisation of the academic workforce. The paper maps the accumulated knowledge of these unit convenors and how this knowledge is "walking out the door". Originality/value: The paper argues that an environment of insecure employment is a barrier to change management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In the last few years, Educational Data Mining has become an interesting area exploited to discover and extract hidden knowledge of students from educational environment data. During the establishment of this work an attempt was made to manage the extracted information using mining techniques. These methods took place in order to get groups of students with similar characteristics. The application of classification, clustering and association rules mining algorithms on the data stored on the e-learning (Moodle system) database allowed to extract knowledges that help to understand students' behaviors and patterns. Additionally, the development of a Web application for the educators is a tool to monitor their students learning behavior by monitoring the number of assignments taken, the number of quizzes taken, the number of forum post and read by students, etc. The knowledge obtained can help the instructors to make decision about their students' interacting with the courses activities in Moodle system, and to create an efficient educational environment. In this research, a Data Mining tool called RapidMiner was used for mining the data from the Moodle system database, and a web application written in PHP was established to aid teachers with statistics Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.

E-Learning is the environment that supports the education field and provides the knowledge of a specific area in one place. Computer Science Education (CSE) is one area that uses the aspects of e-Learning to educate the learners and to distribute the knowledge to them. Several Learning Management Systems (LMSs) support many software tools to manage the theoretical materials of the CSE. However, the practical software tools that are needed by the Computer Science courses are ignored or simply not considered in most of the LMSs. To overcome the limitations of the LMSs towards the practical aspects of the CSE, this paper shows how to prepare the tools and make them available for use anytime through the LMS. For this to work, the authors of this paper take a step forward in discussing how to extend the LMSs functionality in general and Moodle as a special case. This extension involves adding the needed software tool as a component to the architectural structure of Moodle. Moreover, this paper introduces someliterature that supports and implements these kinds of extensions. © 2014 Academy Publisher.

The arrival of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has brought about intense methodological restructuring in the participating countries. These changes, along with the development of ICT, are reshaping the Higher Education system. The emergence of advanced technological tools like the Moodle platform has altered the teaching-learning process at every educational cycle. This paper springs from the work undertaken as part of the ongoing project for Educational Excellence in collaboration with three Andalusia universities: Seville, Cadiz and Huelva. The study was entitled Tele-education Platforms for Virtual Instruction. Since work at the University of Huelva has taken into consideration the students at some point, and the University of Córdoba lacks research on this area, we decided to examine the role of the student at the University of Cordoba as side-work to the original project. To this purpose, we designed an instrument to determine the students' rate of use, level of satisfaction and level of knowledge of the Moodle platform. Thus, with this paper we would like to emphasize the relevance of students as key elements in the education system, as recipients of the teaching process.

Bringing flexibility and extensibility into Learning Management Systems is crucial because it gives teachers and students a free choice of technologies and educational materials they want to use for their courses. This paper presents a solution by enabling widgets (OpenSocial apps) within Moodle. Our first Moodle plugin allows teachers to freely choose a set of tools they want to use in their courses, although students cannot change widgets proposed by teachers. Additionally, the plugin enables the flexible interaction interfaces inside Moodle and improves the interoperability of Moodle with other Web platforms. The environment was evaluated with students within several courses. Even though the environment was perceived as useful by students, they lacked their own personalization. The second Moodle plugin described tackles this problem.

A challenging and demanding task for the teachers in e-learning environments is the assessment of students' performance. Several learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle offer several assessment tools such as quizzes, scales, "classic" rubrics, etc. In this paper, we present a new cloud based assessment tool, called Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R) which is seamlessly integrated into Moodle. LAe-R is based on the concept of the "enriched rubrics", which is becoming a popular assessment technique in education. This technique is a blend of marking criteria and grading levels of a "classic/traditional" rubric and performance indicators stemmed from analysis of learners' interaction and learning behavior in a LMS based e-learning environment. Finally, in this paper we present the findings of a case study scenario showed that LAe-R is a very usable tool and is highly appreciated by teachers and students.

A combination of regular classroom teaching with the use of resources available on the Moodle platform has been designed to foster the development of skills for learning to learn for students in an undergraduate general chemistry course. The use of the Moodle platform essentially aimed at strengthening the students' prior knowledge of chemistry concepts and laws, and at enhancing self-assessment of their study skills. In this combined approach, the use of platform resources is designed to contribute to time management, as well as for information seeking and understanding, in a communication and problem-solving approach. Assessment of the results was made through student surveys, discussion forums, and anecdotal observation by the instructors. The results indicate a high degree of acceptance by students of the use of this combined approach, promoting an increase of self-awareness on their learning process, which is an essential prerequisite for developing self-learning processes throughout life. © 2014 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

In recent decades, the use of the Internet has spread rapidly into diverse social spheres including that of education. Currently, most educational centers make use of e-learning environments created through authoring tool applications like learning content management systems (LCMSs). However, most of these applications currently present accessibility barriers that make the creation of accessible e-learning environments difficult for teachers and administrators. In this paper, the accessibility of the Moodle authoring tool, one of the most frequently used LCMSs worldwide, is evaluated. More specifically, the evaluation is carried out from the perspective of two visually impaired users accessing content through screen readers, as well as a heuristic evaluation considering the World Wide Web Consortium's Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines. The evaluation results demonstrate that Moodle presents barriers for screen reader users, limiting their ability to access the tool. One example of accessibility problems for visually impaired users is the frequent inability to publish learning contents without assistance. In light of these results, the paper offers recommendations that can be followed to reduce or eliminate these accessibility barriers. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Purpose – The use of web-enhanced teaching of the English as a foreign language in higher education in Greece is addressed in this case study which examines the student’s perceptions of online instruction using Moodle as a learning management system (LMS), with and without the use of Facebook (FB) as an adjunctive learning platform. The merging of this collaborative and interactive social platform with a LMS is explored, examining the attitudes of higher education foreign language learners toward Moodle as a LMS, and FB as an adjunctive informal learning environment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Results are drawn from a pre-FB questionnaire after a term using Moodle only, and a post-FB questionnaire following a term using Moodle and FB. Findings – Results suggest that the use of web-based tools and social media changed the way students viewed the role of internet technology in the development of their English language learning. Most students (76 percent) agreed that the addition of FB to the course helped build a sense of community within a learning environment, while 69 percent suggested it enhanced the learning process. Originality/value – Results suggest FB may reinforce communication skills and engagement in the learning process and may support participation and collaborative learning in the formal learning environment provided by Moodle. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is impossible to deny the role social media plays in the lives of our students. University systems for communication among faculty and with students, such as Moodle and Blackboard, have a hard time keeping up in student appeal and ease of operations, and thus, it is appropriate to review how these new methods of connecting affect education. Social media clearly adds new methodologies to the way we interact, in quality, quantity and speed. In this review of the use of Facebook in several small (20-40 students) classes at a leading management school in New Zealand, we assess the level of technology use and specifically the use of Facebook for communication and tests. A total of 169 students provided feedback on how they perceived the value of Facebook as part of their graduate school education in management. They voted Facebook over all other available electronic media as suitable for online quizzes. We conclude that using Facebook for some teaching applications is more promising than some of the other university-based intranet services. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The advances of information technology have significantly changed ways of teaching and learning in education. Compared to Computer Aided Instruction (CAI), Computer Aided Learning (CAL) is student-centered and has become one of the popular ways in learning in different fields. As we all know, the Internet has been commonly used, and a variety of e-learning systems and materials have been designed and applied in schools. Researchers have applied theoretical models, such as TAM, TPB and UTAUT to explore individuals' adoption and acceptance of technologies. In some researches, demographic individual difference has been proposed as an essential factor in adopting technologies. However, more studies have examined cognitiveoriented individual difference, especially Learning Style and Teaching Style, for users' acceptance toward system usage. In this study, we explored how Perceived Teaching Style affects ESL/EFL (English as a Second/Foreign Language) students' adoption of the Moodle Reader System by using a revised TAM. Our results indicated that the ways how Perceived Ease to Use (PE) relates to Perceived Usefulness (PU) from the two Perceived Teaching Style clusters are different. This is valuable information for English course designers or instructors when they consider incorporating e-learning projects into their curriculum. It is also useful for system designers for developing their new learning management systems. For future studies, both Learning Style and Teaching Style will be examined to find out the relationship between the two factors and how they influence system users' acceptance toward the learning management platform.

A lot is being invested in the use of emerging technologies which encompass web-based technologies like Learning Management Systems (Blackboard or Moodle) for teaching and learning in Higher Education institutions across South Africa. The question to ask is, "Are Learning Management Systems the only technology available" to enhance teaching and learning. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether LMS usage has an added advantage in the Higher Education environment as opposed to other technologies like wiki's, blogs, facebook, twitter and Google drive. This paper investigates the enablers and constraints of the lecturers that use an LMS called Blackboard, as opposed to those that use other technologies. A social realist perspective was used to understand the agential influences, structural or cultural in the use of Blackboard's and other technologies. This study could be described as being located within an interpretive paradigm employing qualitative data collection methods as a form of inquiry. An open ended questionnaire was distributed to thirty seven lecturers who use different types of technologies to enhance their teaching and students' learning. Data was analysed into themes that align to the research questions on the survey. Lecturers felt positive about their current use of Blackboard and the support given and felt that it will be beneficial to their teaching and learning practices if other technologies received the same support. This paper recommends that the use of technologies like blogs, wikis and facebook. Creates profound learning experiences that enhance the classroom environment.

In recent years, there has been an increasing adoption of various Learning Management Systems (LMS) in higher education in Sub-Saharan countries. Despite the perceived benefits of these systems to leverage challenges facing education sector in the region, studies show that the majority of them tend to fail; partially or totally. This paper presents a model for evaluating LMS deployed in Higher Education Institutions in Sub-Saharan countries through adopting and extending the updated DeLone and McLean information system success model. The proposed model and the instrument have been validated through a survey of 200 students enrolled in various courses offered via Moodle LMS at University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The findings of this study will help those who are involved in the implementation of LMS in higher education in Sub-Saharan countries to evaluate their existing systems and/or to prepare corrective measures and strategies to avoid future LMS failures.

Computer Science Education (CSE) is one discipline that uses the growing and demanding e-learning environment to deliver the computation and technology knowledge to the learners. CSE needs practical sessions as the main part of its education process. Many Learning Management Systems (LMS) have limited resources towards virtual labs. This hinders the free and direct utilization of the software tools that are needed for CSE. As a consequence, researchers attempted to support the LMSs and develop these resources as built-in components in the LMS itself. In this direction, this paper proposes the usage of the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to overcome the limitations of the LMSs towards the practical sessions of CSE. The software developer uses SOA to develop the needed resources as services and then integrates them in the LMS environment. In this paper, all experimental works are carried out on the Moodle environment since it is an open source and used at the Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Oman. © 2014 SERSC.

Today's ease of access and the volume of knowledge available at the tips of our fingers completely change rules of the game for learning and teaching. Preparing the Web for its 3.0 version i.e. the machine readable version, means publishing facts in a standardized format. It gives the opportunity for using the facts and the knowledge that can be derived not only to teach machines. This chapter proposes a new approach for preparing knowledge resources for learning and testing. The idea is to use structured facts, that Google uses for its Knowledge Graph, in e-learning environment to automate some parts of the education process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Blended learning has already become an indispensable part of education in many fields. However, the majority of existing research on blended learning has assumed homogeneity of disciplines. This study suggests that research highlighting disciplinary effects and differences is much needed to effectively develop courses and tools consonant with the characteristics of each discipline. To help close this research gap, this paper focuses on design education and analyses student experiences in a "blended design studio" that combined the Moodle learning management system, live videoconferencing, and social networking media (Facebook) with traditional face-to-face learning (design studio). Students' perceptions of the methods and tools were elicited through structured and openended questions and qualitative variations in responses were categorised. Subsequent quantitative analysis revealed that the characteristics of soft-applied fields require customisation in blended courses and educational system designs in several ways. © Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 2014.

This paper is based on piloting of blended learning as a transformative learning process in order to keep pace with technological innovation. Our redesign of the course was the intention of the use of blended learning as a tool for high-quality, meaningful and longer lasting knowledge, improvements in learning outcomes and greater engagement of students in learning. We chose Moodle platform as a highly sophisticated learning management system with many modules and its possibilities of application in the learning context to develop the online component as a supplement to classroom lessons. After conducting an analysis of the course and a questionnaire, we concluded that students use all the segments of the online component and they become more engaged, their assignments end on time and at the end they would express their satisfaction with the course redesign. Using the T-test for large independent samples there is statistically significantly better performance in the final test (p<0.01) for students who have used Moodle compared to students from the previous generation attending traditional classes, while in the theoretical part of the exam there are higher grades instead of middle, but without statistical significance (p>0.05), which leads us to the view that blended learning helps, above all, average students to upgrade and advance their knowledge. Considering that many of our student are athletes, blended learning is a good choice for them as they are professionally engaged in sports and they can follow the course and complete their assignments in addition to sports commitments. This piloting will serve as a parameter for future use of blended learning to be more adapted to the needs and objectives of students and eliminate any disadvantages. © by Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2014.

Critical thinking is essential in higher education and professionally. This project arose from concerns about a perceived lack of critical thinking development in Chinese students in a joint Australia-China Business diploma program taught in China in English. Using the Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (Chinese Version) as an exploratory tool, the majority of the joint program students scored between 280 and 350, indicating that they have both strengths and weaknesses in critical thinking. The core of the project was to integrate critical thinking into academic reading with the help of Virtual Learning instruments and develop structured teaching and learning activities in the English reading course to enable the Chinese students to learn to ask, analyze and evaluate their target materials and consequently build up their confidence to use these skills in daily learning and other fields. The study found that our content-based activities and online modules in academic reading have the potential to scaffold construction of an integrated development of students' subject knowledge, language skills, critical thinking and overall learning ability. By the end of this project, participants' perceptions of the reading course have changed; after a semester of reading and thinking activities, they no longer saw the reading course just as a means to learn grammar and accumulate vocabulary and knowledge. With the learning modules designed to promote students' capability of critical thinking as well as language proficiency in academic reading, students also realized the importance of asking questions, learned how to make inquiries, and search for answers. © 2014 Asian EFL Journal.

In today's open and dynamic learning environment, a significant percentage of students have a preference for flexible learning systems whereby they can reconcile their academic pursuits with their job responsibilities and family obligations. Non face-to-face educational models, like e-learning (electronic learning), evolved in order to offer such flexibility. E-learning systems have major strengths but also pose major challenges to the educational community. One such challenge is the large spatial and temporal gap between the teacher and student, which is an obstacle to student follow-up by teachers. The information generated by virtual learning systems sometimes overwhelms instructors who are unable to process the data without the support of special-purpose techniques and tools that are useful for analysing large dataflows. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This teaching system was built on materials prepared by experts in biotechnology and management with the contribution of the students themselves, engendered by their discussions about real life based business situations. This system is fully supported by the resources available within the Moodle platform, especially the adaptability of content depending on the profile of the students. But this system goes beyond this. It promotes constant teacher-student and student-student interaction; it achieves this by using all the possibilities offered by the network, by using an approach that stimulates participation in different forums and recommends a series of scheduled tasks based upon the company they work for. The goal of this system is to organize and take advantage of all the available knowledge, and especially that which the students themselves build in each edition, so that the following edition participants can profit from it.

Currently, there is an increasing interest in the introduction of web-based technologies in education. Online learning is evolutionary and is spreading rapidly in an attempt to cover the obstacles of distance, time pressure, educational costs, and even environmental factors. One of the main factors interfering with its usage is the acceptance rate it faces by its participants. In this paper, dependant factors for this form of learning has been investigated through a course applied to a Greek primary education department students.

Facebook is commonly used in the daily lives of higher-education students. Facebook groups are considered educational tools that can be used as learning management system (LMS) substitutes or supplements. However, the effect of using Facebook groups on learning in the computer engineering field has not been adequately compared with that of using other types of LMS and must be explored. The results of this study indicated that the participants in a Facebook group academically outperformed those using iCas and Moodle did. Moreover, users of the Facebook group held a more positive attitude toward learning than did users of the other two types of LMS, a more positive attitude toward interaction than did Moodle users, and higher technological self-efficacy and willingness to use LMSs as well as higher learning motivation compared with users of iCas. The participants' experience of adopting LMSs in their learning as well as constraints are described and discussed. The results are valuable for instructors seeking to adopt a Facebook group as their LMS.

This paper reports an experience of ICT application using mobile devices on an educational scenario on a basic education environment. We present a pilot project developed by the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab), from the Federal University of Santa Catarina and coexecuted by the School of Basic Education Maria Garcia Pessi in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The project has the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and the mining company Vale do Rio Doce, in the framework of a Formation-Engineering program that intends to stimulate the vocational interest of basic education students for the engineering profession and for scientific and technological research. The proposed development is based on educational content that can be accessed through mobile devices and supplemented through the use of remote experiments. The integration between mobile devices, virtual learning environments, and remotely accessed experiments provides students with a new way to interact with the discipline of physics in a simple and enjoyable way, anywhere and anytime. The architecture implemented in this pilot project is entirely based on open source resources, both software and hardware, including the learning management system (Moodle), the RExMobile app, and the remote experiments developed by RExLab. © 2014 IEEE.

This paper reports on a project that was first introduced to World Conference on Mobile and Contextual Learning attendees in 2012, the PLEIADES project (Portable Learning Environments for Incarcerated Adult Distance Education Students) and discusses how this project evolved into two separate projects; one each from the two technologies originally trialled. PLEIADES introduced a version of an internet-independent version of the Learning Management System (LMS) called Stand Alone Moodle (SAM) and eBook readers to incarcerated students in a correctional centre in Southern Queensland. The Triple ‘E’ Project (Empowerment, E-Learning and E-Readers) using eBook readers similar to those trialled in the PLEIADES project, were rolled out to a further four correctional centres. This paper explores the issues and challenges involved with deploying eBook readers to incarcerated students through the PLEIADES and Triple ‘E’ projects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

e-Learning is getting more important in education to provide new or enhanced services. Learning objects created according to e-learning standards such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) play a major role in order to produce quality contents for e-learning. A virtual learning environment (VLE) is normally used to support e-learning by providing online courses and other learning activities. Moodle is one of the most widely used VLEs. However, Moodle still does not support the SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation. This article proposes a new technique to create an e-tutorial module, one of the main services in e-learning that supports a certain level of SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation on Moodle version 1.9.2+. This helps to provide learning with more control on the learning sequences and hence supports remediation learning strategy. Besides, study shows that courses built with learning objects complying with the SCORM 2004 standards are interoperable. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An ongoing challenge to occupational therapy educators is how to provide resources and strategies that best assist students in learning, retaining, and replicating protocols in clinical manual assessment. This pilot survey study explored how 43 first-year master's of occupational therapy students enrolled in a kinesiology course perceived the value of implementing instructor-produced YouTube® videos of in-class assessment demonstrations. The videos, taken on a smartphone, were uploaded to a private YouTube URL created by the instructor and then linked to a pre-established Moodle learning platform. By the end of the 6-wk course, students had registered 2,573 views averaging 60 views per student. Postcourse mixed survey results revealed students perceived that the videos improved the quality of the course, increased their level of engagement and learning, and boosted confidence in their manual skills. Survey results also found that students correlated the instructor's willingness to develop online videos with a commitment to student learning.

In an effort to enhance the learning process in higher education, a new model for Competition-Based Learning (CBL) is presented. The new model utilizes two well-known learning models, namely, the Project-Based Learning (PBL) and competitions. The new model is also applied in a networked environment with emphasis on collective learning as well as collective outcomes. The new model, which is referred to as CBL, provides educators with an alternative solution to overcome many of student's deficiencies associated with traditional learning practices; such as lack of motivation, lack of self esteem, insufficient practical and real-life experience, and inadequate team work practices. The new CBL model makes a clear distinction between PBL and competitions and CBL. It avoids the disadvantages of competitions, while at the same time gaining from the many benefits of PBL. Identification features of CBL, components of CBL, as well as advantages are presented. An open source Learning Management System (LMS), namely, Moodle is used for the implementation of a networked environment to support CBL. Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.

Recommendation systems have been widely used in internet activities whose aim is to present the important and useful information to the user with little effort. Course Recommendation System is system which recommends to students the best combination of courses in engineering education system e.g. if student is interested in course like system programming then he would like to learn the course entitled compiler construction. The algorithm with combination of two data mining algorithm i.e. combination of Expectation Maximization Clustering and Apriori Association Rule Algorithm have been developed. The result of this developed algorithm is compared with Apriori Association Rule Algorithm which is an existing algorithm in open source data mining tool Weka. © 2014, The Institution of Engineers (India).

The General Accounting subject is on the curricula of five different bachelor's degrees offered in the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Granada (UGR), Spain. In a coordinated way, all the lecturers involved in this subject have generated interactive materials and a methodology that allows students to undertake online self-assessment activities that are very similar to the final exam. Following a blended-learning methodology, General Accounting combines classroom education techniques with the use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools, and the students work to improve their grades. In the 2012/13 academic year, students on two of the degrees were consulted about their overall satisfaction with using this platform. From the results, we can highlight the positive appraisal of the interestingness and usefulness of activities on the platform. We also obtained a positive correlation between the students' access to the activities and the grades obtained in them, and the final grades obtained in the subject.

Merging Immersive Virtual Environments, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques provides a number of advantages to develop Intelligent Environments for multiple applications. This paper is focused on the application of these technologies to develop intelligent learning environments. Education is one of the most interesting applications of immersive virtual environments, as their flexibility can be exploited in order to create heterogeneous groups from all over the world who can collaborate synchronously in different virtual spaces. We highlight the potential of virtual worlds as an educative tool and propose a model to create learning environments within Second Life or OpenSimulator combining the Moodle learning management system, embodied conversational metabots, and programmable 3D objects. Our proposal has been applied in several subjects of the Computer Science degree in the Carlos III University of Madrid. The results of the evaluation show that developed learning environment fosters engagement and collaboration and helps students to better understand complex concepts. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this work, a developed e-learning system for the final project of engineering undergraduate students is evaluated as a miniature of engineering education in one of the Indonesian universities (i.e., Universitas Gadjah Mada). Several challenges faced during the system realization have been accommodated by involving the use of both learning materials and experiences. For its problem-solving approach, Fink’s taxonomy has been combined in a system with semantic technology, based on the ontology method. Therefore, the results of ontology design can then be integrated to the learning management system (LMS) of Moodle, which allows semantic resource queries. By means of the e-learning experimental results with six components of Fink’s taxonomy as the measurement aspects, it is obviously shown that the e-learning system has significantly influenced the application, learning how to learn, integration, and foundational knowledge aspects. Moreover, it provides a strong indication that the realized system can assist engineering undergraduate students to reduce the required duration of their final projects. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Background. Cardiothoracic surgical education faces numerous challenges, including reduced duty hours and diminishing prioritization of teaching, in the setting of rapidly advancing knowledge, skills, and case complexity. Pass rates on the American Board of Thoracic Surgery exam remain suboptimal, and new training formats are being evaluated. We hypothesize that Internet-based courses can be developed and implemented to supplement learning of basic topics in cardiothoracic surgery. Methods. After a needs assessment, 4 online self-study courses were developed by content experts using a Moodle [modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment] platform. As a pilot cohort, students from 4 thoracic surgery training programs participated, accessing courses at their own pace. Each course included general and detailed readings, multimedia content, discussion forum, and a question-bank supported quiz (90% required to pass, multiple attempts allowed). Utilization and exam data were tracked electronically. The t tests were used to compare first versus final-year traditional track trainees. Post-course surveys collected data on trainee attitudes. Results. Nineteen students completed 4 courses on tracheal disease. Mean time spent per course and quiz attempts to pass were 1.35 hours and 2.86, respectively. Scores improved with successive attempts. Senior trainees showed a trend toward less time per course and fewer quiz attempts. Post-course surveys uniformly demonstrated perceived benefits from the content and quizzes in an easy-to-navigate format. Conclusions. Online courses can be developed and integrated within cardiothoracic training programs. This pilot demonstrates evidence of active learning as shown through the embedded assessments. Internet-based courses may serve as a means of supplementing modern thoracic surgical training. Further development and evaluation are warranted. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Learning content management systems (LCMSs) have become increasingly popular in the educational field over the past few years. However, problems in system design can create difficulties in the interactions between LCMSs and an important sector of the user population. The assessment and monitoring of LCMS accessibility are vital for the guarantee of universal accessibility in education. This article presents a comparative study of the accessibility of three web-based, open-source LCMSs: Moodle, ATutor, and Sakai. Results of the study indicate that barriers to accessibility are present in each of the three systems evaluated. A primary aim of the study is to help detect and correct these barriers such that the goal of universal access in educational environments may one day be achieved. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Faculty of Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) offers a core first-year engineering design and innovation course, ENGG1000, undertaken during the first and second semesters. This course is highly regarded in the sense that it provides an introduction to many concepts and activities that students will experience over the four-year minimum for which they are undergraduates at UNSW. Approximately 1400 students enrol in the semester 1 course across the Faculty, typically 80 of which undertake the Mining Engineering stream. Students in teams of between six and eight design and construct a physical model to represent an aspect of their chosen discipline. For example, in 2013 the mining engineers designed and built a model dragline. This paper concentrates a major aspect of the course - the involvement of team members in group activities and the development of the associated skills of peer assessment and peer review as the course progresses over a period of 12 weeks. The term 'peer assessment' in this paper refers to the requirement for students to assess the design components of their peers. This course has a structured requirement in terms of how a successful design is a result of a sound design process rather than a 'try and see' approach. Each student must describe in detail the process they undertook to achieve their final design - hence the approach is independent of the discipline and/or project selected. Peer review is a process whereby students review the contribution of their team members to the overall design. This activity encourages team involvement and interaction. The final assessment mark can be moderated by the outcome of this peer review, although it is run twice during the semester. The first 'run' is for feedback only during week six and hence no moderation is undertaken. It was found through consultation with students and from questionnaires that both processes are well accepted and highly regarded by students, as they give them a degree of ownership of the assessment process. In addition, the processes provide rapid and relevant feedback on the progress of individual students. Peer review and peer assessment are also considered to be very valuable tools for use in courses in succeeding years. For instance, many of the courses in mining engineering rely heavily on group assessment tasks. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2014.

Over the past 20 years most countries, particularly developing countries, have seen a large increase in the number of students seeking higher education. A consequence of this growth is increasing pressure on teaching staff and institutions, usually resulting in, among other effects, increased class size. Large classes of between 300 and 1,000, and even more, at the undergraduate level are not uncommon in a number of countries (Mulryan-Kyne in Teach High Educ 15(2):175-185, 2010). Large classes are often perceived as one of the major obstacles to the attainment of quality education. Despite the difficulties associated with teaching and learning in large classes, they remain a reality in many countries affecting learners across all levels of the education system and are often the only perceived option available to meet growing demand for higher education in Sub-Saharan Africa (Mohamedbhai in The effects of massification on higher education in Africa. Report from the Working Group on Higher Education of the Association for the Development of Education in Africa, 2008). We contend that the challenges of delivering large classes can be confronted, and in many ways diminished, through the use of current and emerging technologies and enhanced faculty development. In this expository paper, we present findings from project activities focused on higher education faculty development and capacity building. The findings include both formative and summative development activities, as well as data collected in faculty professional development workshops and the results of two surveys. We use these data to lay out issues, challenges (e.g., skills, resources, logistics-including poor campus infrastructure), and opportunities (e.g., mobile capacity, distance tools such as Moodle) of large class pedagogy using a design-based research framework. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Abstract: This article reflects on the successes and failures of a new Philosophy and Ethics course in a low socioeconomic context in Perth, Western Australia, with the eventual demise of the subject in the school at the end of 2010. We frame this reflection within Deleuzian notions of geophilosophy to advocate for a Philosophy and Ethics that is informed by nomadic thought, as this offers a critical freedom for students to transform themselves and their society and suggests practical ways both of overcoming the prejudices which led to its demise and of student reluctance to engage in open discussion in class. We consider the demise of the course a ‘missed opportunity’ because it had so much potential to be transformative of student subjectivities in schools. © 2013, © 2013 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.

The present study aimed to describe the development process of a serious game that enables users to evaluate the respiratory process in a preterm infant based on an emotional design model. The e-Baby serious game was built to feature the simulated environment of an incubator, in which the user performs a clinical evaluation of the respiratory process in a virtual preterm infant. The user learns about the preterm baby's history, chooses the tools for the clinical evaluation, evaluates the baby, and determines whether his/her evaluation is appropriate. The e-Baby game presents phases that contain respiratory process impairments of higher or lower complexity in the virtual preterm baby. Included links give the user the option of recording the entire evaluation procedure and sharing his/her performance on a social network. e-Baby integrates a Clinical Evaluation of the Preterm Baby course in the Moodle virtual environment. This game, which evaluates the respiratory process in preterm infants, could support a more flexible, attractive, and interactive teaching and learning process that includes simulationswith features very similar to neonatal unit realities, thus allowing more appropriate training for clinical oxygenation evaluations in at-risk preterm infants. e-Baby allows advanced user-technologyeducational interactions because it requires active participation in the process and is emotionally integrated.

The main objective of this study was to analyse the pre-service students and in-service teachers' rating of the Letra program. This program is a tutorial system that uses the MOODLE learning platform to create a virtual learning environment. The Letra program incorporates recommendations from the latest scientific report on learning how to read, the National Reading Panel, which determines what critical skills should be taught to ensure that children's reading education is successful and thus help avoid any future difficulties that may arise in this area. These critical skills are: phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, fluency and vocabulary and comprehension. A sample of pre-service students from the Canary Islands, and in-service teachers from México, Guatemala and Ecuador participated in the Letra program. Positive ratings were received by both the pre-service and in-service teachers, and these ratings were not mediated by experience in receiving previous online professional courses. © 2014 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

Web-based and adapted e-learning materials provide alternative methods of learning to those used in a traditional classroom. Within the study described in this article, deaf and hard of hearing people used an adaptive e-learning environment to improve their computer literacy. This environment included streaming video with sign language interpreter video and subtitles. The courses were based on the learning management system Moodle, which also includes sign language streaming videos and subtitles. A different approach is required when adapting e-learning courses for the deaf and hard of hearing: new guidelines must be developed concerning the loading and display of video material. This is shown in the example of the e-learning course, ECDL (European Computer Driving Licence). The usability of the e-learning course is analyzed and confirmed using two methods: first, the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) evaluation method, and second, the Adapted Pedagogical Index (AdaPI), which was developed as part of this study, and gives an index to measure the pedagogical effectiveness of e-learning courses adapted for people with disabilities. With 116 participants, of whom 22 are deaf or hard of hearing, the e-learning course for the target group has been found suitable and appropriate according to both evaluation methods. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

This paper presents a virtual lab for the contents of an Engineering project, for designing an agro-industrial building, which is also useful for a range of different transversal courses in Engineering sciences. The aims of this tool are to analyse the most important contents of a project-document (calculation, regulations, drawings and budgets), as well as their relationship with the activities which make up the work and the schedule. The design criteria we considered were: its online applications and their compatibility with Moodle, the inclusion of different learning approaches, such as exploratory learning and inquiry-based learning; its interactivity, and the use of multimedia elements for visualisation and direct analysis on material common to Engineering subjects. The students’ perceptions of the improvements brought by the virtual lab were analysed statistically through a series of questions over two academic years. The results of the questionnaires suggested that most of those who had used the e-learning tool valued positively its overall suitability for reaching the objectives in their subject as well as the way it improved the working methodology. The practical knowledge acquired by the students was also highly valued. In addition, the lack of constraints commonly related to field trips (expenses, time and complexity) illustrates the utility of self-access learning tools in key transversal disciplines such as Engineering projects. © 2013 SEFI.

The agricultural education system has undergone several changes in India from past few decades. There are different courses at graduate and postgraduate level for imparting training to the agriculture students to improve agriculture and allied sectors in our country. An e-learning course has been developed, to make the freshly passed agriculture students and agri business field assistants suitable for agri business industries. This study was conducted in Ikisan Limited, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh during 2009 and 2010. To develop the course, surveys were conducted with agriculture students and individuals at managerial level in agri business industries. The gaps that exist between knowledge/skills/attitudes for agriculture students and agri business industries were analyzed. The courses were selected based on gap analysis to assist the students in structuring their career. The content for the courses were obtained from various sources, made into IMS content package using eXe editor and were uploaded in Moodle which is a Learning Management System. The users can access the course online according to their convenience from any place. This module is useful and provides flexibility to working professionals and students who may not attend class room teaching.

Networked learning environments that embed the essence of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework utilise pedagogies that encourage dialogic practices. This can be of significance for classroom teaching across all curriculum areas. In science education, networked environments are thought to support student investigations of scientific problems, including the collection and processing of data, and construction of explanations and conclusions. Student engagement that involves thinking about and questioning key scientific processes and ideas is argued to address the challenges of making school science more relevant. In this article, examples from two studies are presented where New Zealand teachers employed networked technologies, including Moodle (a learning management system) and Wallwisher (an online notice board). These examples illustrate how face-to-face classroom teaching practices can be complemented with online learning practices. The CoI framework was used to examine how the social, cognitive and teaching dimensions of online student communities were similar and yet distinct to the face-to-face communities they belonged to. Findings showed that the CoI framework helped to unpack how networked environments created hybrid spaces where classroom interaction possibilities were extended, and new layers of knowledge construction added in support of students' growing authority and accountability for their learning.

M-learning extends the theory and practice of learning and mobility in converging technological environments. Developing a smart course in order to improve the standard of education at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) is one of the main aims of the current authors. This proposal requires developing innovative applications for ubiquitous, mobile technologies for learning. This kind of development covers new educational and technological methods and concepts for supporting formal and informal learning. SQU is currently using Moodle as the open source e-learning management system to support and enhance traditional learning. Although e-learning in SQU has proven its importance in enhancing traditional learning, it is limited to areas and locations where a personal computer exists. This constraint is a burden to many e-learning users who are staff or students, especially if they live in rural areas of Oman. To overcome this drawback, an investigative survey of the importance of m-learning was designed and distributed to SQU students. The results showed that almost all students favored and supported the idea and requested the implementation of a m-learning application. As a step forward, this paper proposes an extension for e-learning-a new m-learning tool to support learners who use mobile device technologies. Our goal in introducing m-learning at SQU is not to replace e-learning but to complement and improve it so both modalities are available, since each grants certain advantages to users.

Time pressures often necessitate the use of more efficient exam tools, such as electronic exams (e-exams), instead of traditional paper exams. However, teachers may face challenges when introducing e-exams in a higher education context. This paper describes what kinds of challenges teachers may face when introducing e-exams, based on experiences in Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) where e-exams have been used since 2012. For this research, the authors used their personal experiences as administrators and teachers of current e-systems used for e-exams in universities in Turku, Finland. Quantitative data were collected by survey from teachers in TUAS (the case study). The learning management systems, Moodle, Optima and ViLLE, and dedicated e-examination systems, Soft Tutor and Tenttis, were also compared to clarify what kind of features are available in order to ease teachers' work with examinations. The results identified various challenges during e-exam introduction in TUAS. The paper also provides a list of essential services or features for teachers to ease the introduction of e-exams. Among the analysed systems, ViLLE supported most of the required features, and can be used for both learning management and e-examination systems, providing teachers with one single system, which was found to be important to teachers. The key service found by this paper is 'support for teachers', which is in line with previous studies. © 2014 M. Kuikka et al.

Online Cooperative Learning (OCoL) provides a different experience compared to Conventional Cooperative Learning (CCoL). The implementation of OCoL uses various web-based tools to support elements of Cooperative Learning such as face to face interaction. This study looks into the patterns of interaction on OCoL using group investigation as learning method. A Learning management system namely Moodle (LMS) was chosen as a platform to run this OCoL. A group of 15 students from one of the academic programmes at one of our local universities were selected randomly to carry out six learning sessions using OCoL. OCoL learning activities are classified into: learning activities, use of interactive tools, and structure of learning to facilitate the process of analysis. A pattern of interaction was identified through quantitative and qualitative analysis of log data in usage of OCoL through six learning sessions which recorded automatically. Several patterns of interaction were identified and classified by learning session, learning structure, and number of access. Analysis found that students showed a high number of accesses in the early learning session, but this number decreased at the middle and final learning session which students tend towards individual activities such as information searching as well as group investigation method. The results of this study proposes a set of guidelines of design and implementation of online cooperative learning and also learning management system which is widely used as e-learning system in higher education institution. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

OBJECTIVE: This work sought to analyze the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and social networks among the university nursing faculty staff in Spain.METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study using a questionnaire on ICT skills designed to comply with the research objective, which was evaluated by experts and which was subjected to exploratory analysis of principal components; the reliability of this instrument measured with Cronbach's alpha was 0.85. The information technology tool used to publish the questionnaire on line was Limesurvey. The sample comprised 165 professors from 25 Nursing Faculties and Schools from universities in Spain.RESULTS: Seventy one percent of the total surveyed used internet services to look for information, 63% used the internet as a means for formation and learning, and 72% used it as a communication platform (e-mail and virtual platforms like Sakai and Moodle). Although 51% of the teaching staff surveyed had more than 120 students registered in their courses, hypothesis testing revealed that the number of students in class is not a determining factor for the teaching staff to have greater interest to update its knowledge in ICTs. Younger professors use new technologies more profusely and the most-valued advantage of using ICTs was quick access to information. Professors perceive that after the Bologna Declaration, which requires modifying their teaching-learning processes through the new teaching methodologies, a drop has been produced in their performance and that of their peers in their area of knowledge.CONCLUSION: The nursing teaching staff is making strong efforts to confront the new challenges posed by ICTs to train the professionals of the 21st century. It is fundamental to pay special attention to improving the university teaching staff's skills in managing ICTs, promoting the implementation of the knowledge acquired.

Background: In clinical research scientific, legal as well as ethical aspects are important. It is well known that clinical investigators at university hospitals have to undertake their PhD-studies alongside their daily work and reconciling work and study can be challenging. The aim of this project was to create a web based course in clinical research bioethics (5 credits) and to examine whether the method is suitable for teaching bioethics. The course comprised of six modules: an initial examination (to assess knowledge in bioethics), information on research legislation, obtaining permissions from authorities, writing an essay on research ethics, preparing one's own study protocol, and a final exam. All assignments were designed with an idea of supporting students to reflect on their learning with their own research. Methods. 57 PhD-students (medical, nursing and dental sciences) enrolled and 46 completed the course. Course evaluation was done using a questionnaire. The response rate was 78%. Data were analyzed using quantitative methods and qualitative content analysis. Results: The course was viewed as useful and technically easy to perform. Students were pleased with the guidance offered. Personal feedback from teachers about students' own performance was seen advantageous and helped them to appreciate how these aspects could be applied their own studies. The course was also considered valuable for future research projects. Conclusions: Ethical issues and legislation of clinical research can be understood more easily when students can reflect the principles upon their own research project. Web based teaching environment is a feasible learning method for clinical investigators. © 2013 Halkoaho et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Nowadays one witnesses a rapid development of technology. Children are more prone to a faster and better acceptance of such a development. Classes must be adapted to meet the current trends and be tailored to the user. In the course of the school year there is a number of periods when pupils are absent from class due to the influenza epidemics. Based on the analysis of attendance at the level of primary and secondary education of students with special needs in the school "Milan Petrović" and the primary school "The First Brigade of Vojvodina" in Novi Sad, a team of experts of various educational profiles, have proposed that the distance learning techniques using electronic learning (E-learning) be introduced into teaching. The procedure was preceded by a survey of pupils and parents. Based on the data collected, the educational software Moodle was selected because of its accessibility and ease of use. In collaboration with the research station "Petnica" Telenor and the town Novi Sad, the Internet portal "Milanče" was created, on which interesting and stimulating lessons and teaching materials intended for children were posted. Student achievement was found to be improved but not all educational materials could be appropriately used in the electronic form.

This paper presents an analysis of learning effectiveness for the courses "Selected issues in visual rehabilitation" and "Ophthalmology and oph- thalmic nursing" taught in the years 2009-2011 at the Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. We compared the effectiveness of traditional and distance learning methods; an e-learning platform was implemented experimentally for the purpose of this study. We assessed the usefulness of online learning in terms of organization, knowledge gained and students' satisfaction with the course. The study was conducted among 75 second year master degree students in the nursing field in the academic years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. The students were divided into two groups. For the study group of 39 persons (52%), lectures and seminars took place on an e-learning platform, while 36 persons (48%) in the control group attended traditional classes. 80% of students in the e-learning group and 89% of students in the traditional group assessed the organization of both forms of courses positively. The fact that the majority of students in both the e-learning (89%) and traditional classes (86%) gave positive feedback indicates that for both forms there was a high level of content and technical preparedness. The mean scores of the final exam for both courses were 82% in the e-learning group and 79% in the traditional group in the years 2009-2011. The above results show that both forms of learning are equally effective.

In this paper, students' practices while using a Learning Content Management System in a blended learning environment were examined. This is a case study involving 337 students who attended an academic course based upon a blended learning approach over three years using Moodle. Eighteen variables depicting the students' perceptions of Moodle, as well as their interaction with it, were examined using four complementary data mining and statistical analysis approaches: visualisation, decision trees, class association rules and clustering. The analysis of the collected data shows that failure in the course was associated with negative attitudes and perceptions of the students towards Moodle. On the other hand excellent grades were associated with increased use of the LCMS. Requirements elicitation of a learning analytics dashboard, are also discussed.Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

It is essential to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance early during the course of the semester and to take precautions using such prediction-based information. This will, in particular, help enhance their academic performance and, therefore, improve the overall educational quality. The present study was on the development of a mathematical model intended to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance using the first eight-week data on the learning management system. First, two fuzzy models were constructed, namely the classical fuzzy model and the expert fuzzy model, the latter being based on expert opinion. Afterwards, a gene-fuzzy model was developed optimizing membership functions through genetic algorithm. The data on distance education were collected through Moodle, an open source learning management system. The data were on a total of 218 students who enrolled in Basic Computer Sciences in 2012. The input data consisted of the following variables: When a student logged on to the system for the last time after the content of a lesson was uploaded, how often he/she logged on to the system, how long he/she stayed online in the last login, what score he/she got in the quiz taken in Week 4, and what score he/she got in the midterm exam taken in Week 8. A comparison was made among the predictions of the three models concerning the students' year-end academic performance.

E-learning is a learning system that has become a trend in education nowadays. One of the applications that is often used is Moodle. In this research, the authors designed an OERI application to support the learning material. The application uses the technique of service-oriented architecture in the search for educational services in three repositories which are DBPedia, Ariadne and OpenLearn. The application itself will be installed as plugins in Moodle. The focus in this research is the support of the educational material in the three educational repositories used which concerns how the three educational repositories can produce a relevant educational material document with the desired query. The measurement uses precision to measure the accuracy of the query, and along with it we will also measure the number of documents retrieved, and the number of documents types retrieved. Then these results will be used to compare the three educational repositories. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

USALSIM is a project developed by the University of Salamanca as a response to the policy changes of learning and work placements in the new European Space for Higher Education, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and inscribed within an innovation programme regarding the employability of university students (CAIE059). The contribution of USALSIM is concerned with how to face the increase in the number of students who will participate in the different university work placement programmes and the increasing number of companies and institutions necessary to host and train theses students. This project uses a 3D virtual environment (a work placement simulator) that creates a virtual representation of different work environments and allows students to acquire professional skills. Representing a professional workspace such as a laboratory, for example, the student can simulate common tasks through active learning. This virtual world is focused on a constructive pedagogy, whereby students are directly involved in their formative development, establishing professional relationships, developing transversal and technical competencies, and evaluating their knowledge. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Objective - To outline the collaborative development of an online course addressing academic integrity by a university's library system and writing centre. Design - Case study. Setting - A public research university in the Midwestern United States. Subjects - 1650 students who completed the online module. Methods - Oakland University (OU) Libraries and the Writing Centre began to collaborate on the development of a new online course on academic integrity in 2011. It was felt that an existing online library tutorial on plagiarism no longer met the needs of students and faculty. The development of the course was informed by the Association of College and Research Libraries' Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) as well as a research study investigating students' use of sources in their scholarly writing across several institutions. Moodle, the institution's learning management system (LMS), was used to develop the learning object. Main Results - OU Libraries and the Writing Centre launched the six-part online course entitled "Using and Citing Sources" in January 2012. They developed modules aroundlearning outcomes in five broad categories: defining academic integrity and plagiarism; the use of sources in academic writing; paraphrasing; quoting; and citation. The final module provided students with an opportunity to practise lessons learned in the first five modules. The use of the LMS to design and host the course limited the tutorial to registered students, but provided developers with access to additional course functionality without labour-intensive coding. It also allowed Writing Centre staff to access students' performance data on the modules prior to their appointments. Improvements over the previous online tutorial included expanded content on academic ethics and referencing, more active learning elements, video content, and the opportunity for students to choose discipline-specific examples. In the first four months of its availability, 1650 students completed the course, with 3330 attempts overall. Conclusion - The diverse perspectives and expertise that individuals from OU Libraries and the Writing Center brought to their collaboration greatly informed the development of the course. The time and effort saved by using the university's existing LMS to develop interactive content and the focus on providing students with opportunities for active learning within the course contributed to the project's success. © 2013 Merkley.

Learning management systems (LMSs) contain hidden costs, unclear user environments, bulky developer and administration manuals, and limitations with regard to interoperability, integration, localization, and bandwidth requirements. Careful evaluation is required in selecting the most appropriate LMS for use, and this is a general problem in web-based education. One possibility is to automate this evaluation process using computer-aided techniques. In this article, the researcher has focused on the idea of automating the evaluation process and has developed a computer-aided system named Easy Way to Evaluate LMSs (EW-LMS), for the quick and efficient evaluation of LMSs, especially for developing countries, where the idea of using an LMS may be relatively new. The investigation described in this article was carried out with 88 voluntary higher education instructors to test the usefulness of the developed system. Two types of quantitative questionnaires were used during the study. The results obtained indicate that the instructors were highly satisfied using the developed system, and the EW-LMS is technically sound and well developed. Theevaluation system can help instructors to select the best LMS appropriate to their educational needs and their type of usage in the shortest possible time, with little effort, without any specialized technical knowledge/training and by following simple, user-friendly steps. The system is oriented to anyone interested in evaluating and using an LMS in web-based education. Those individuals who may be interested in using this software are instructors, students, or anyone else who may have an interest in LMSs, and educational organizations such as universities, schools, and institutes. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Represents management systems learning (Learning Management systems) device used by most of the central institutions of higher education to support the educational process. And contrasts the performance of these systems with the increasing demand decentralization among Higher Education and Alhath, the use of open tools and services that contribute increasingly to promote a wide range of educational activities and practices outside institutional boundaries.With the proliferation of social networks (social networks) as one of the applications outstanding in the second generation of the Web (Web 2.0), called for the need to replace management systems traditional learning to other systems more open to keep up with the changes accelerated in web technologies and are consistent with the way the new generation with the network. Thus was born a new form of learning and management systems that combine the characteristics of traditional learning management systems and social networks.Of these modern systems site (schoology.com), which offers a free service for creating and managing learning systems, and mixing interface social networking with the management tools of learning, so that teachers and students (and parents and administrators) of communication and cooperation in educational matters. The site also provides educational traditional jobs in the months learning systems such as Blackboard and Moodle.

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have become endemic, crippling trade and livelihood for many, and in rare cases, resulting in human fatalities. It is imperative that up-to-date education and training in accessible and interactive formats be available to key target audiences like poultry producers, backyard flock owners, and emergency responders. Online tools such as Moodle™, Secon Life™, and Facebook are excellent resources for Extension educators and have been implemented in the arsenal of the avian influenza biosecurity program. However, each online tool has its pros and cons, and Extension educators must use the best tool for each target audience. © by Extension Journal,Inc.

In the context of widening participation, large classes and increased diversity, assessment of student learning is becoming increasingly problematic in that providing formative feedback aimed at developing student writing proves to be particularly laborious. Although the potential value of peer assessment has been well documented in the literature, the associated administrative burden, also in relation to managing anonymity and intellectual ownership, makes this option less attractive, particularly in large classes. A potential solution involves the use of information and communication technologies to automate the logistics associated with peer assessment in a time-efficient way. However, uptake of such systems in the higher education community is limited, and research in this area is only beginning. This case study reports on the use of the Moodle Workshop module for formative peer assessment of students' individual work in a first-year introductory macro-economics class of over 800 students. Data were collected through an end-of-course evaluation survey of students. The study found that using the feature-rich Workshop module not only addressed many of the practical challenges associated with paper-based peer assessments, but also provided a range of additional options for enhancing validity and reliability of peer assessments that would not be possible with paper-based systems. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Online teaching has long been a key area of interest recently in every field of education as well as English language teaching. Numerous hardware tools, such as, mp3 players, mobile devices, and so on; and software applications, such as, podcasts, wikis, learning management systems, and so on, have been used in distance and online instruction and they have proved to be useful in facilitating learning individually (Finger, Sun, & Jamieson-Proctor, 2010). Learning management systems (LMS) provide a virtual environment and various tools to support learning. The current institution where the researchers work deliver two 2-credit online English courses for a specific group of learners at a state university in south-eastern Turkey by using Modular Object Oriented Distance Learning Environment (MOODLE). Moodle is an open code LMS which provides teachers and course developers with numerous online tools to enhance distance learning/teaching environment. The course has both a synchronous and asynchronous instruction. Synchronous and asynchronous instructions are associated with the delivery of content in campus-based environments; however, their role differs in offthe campus environments as they solve the problems of distance learners. Universities, colleges, and other education institutions are integrating online learning into every aspect of higher education. Many teachers and faculty members at higher education institutions who already run face-to-face courses have a website to post lecture notes or slide presentations as well as other course material. There is no doubt that these are effective strategies to expand teaching efforts. Still, there are other educators who design and teach totally online classes. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate learners' attitudes towards these online language courses, and there are two objectives of this research. The first one is to discover learners' attitudes towards the online English course; and the second purpose is to evaluate and correlate learners' attitudes with their success determined with their end-of-the-year grades. For the unique purpose of this study, an Online Language Learning Attitude Test (OLLAT) has been constructed and distributed to about 7000 learners who were invited to complete this task online. 3516 of these learners took the OLLAT voluntarily and 1783 were successfully completed the test and were included in this study. The findings showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between learners' OLLAT scores and their course success.

Learning management systems (LMSs) in higher education institutions (HEIs) provide the potential for rich learning environments built on social constructivist theories under the concept of blended (b-)learning. An essential factor, however, in determining the efficacy of online teaching-learning is the users' quality of interaction (QoI) with LMSs; yet, in many cases, QoI has not been properly acquired, mainly, due to its inherent qualitative character. Stemming from the latter, this study introduces a new model, namely FuzzyQoI, that, by employing fuzzy logic constructs, it quantitatively estimates the users' (professors' and students') QoI with the LMS Moodle within a b-learning environment. In the FuzzyQoI model, a set of 110 LMS Moodle metrics is considered to form 12 codified inputs to a five-level fuzzy inference system equipped with 600 expert's fuzzy rules. The potential and effectiveness of the realisation of the FuzzyQoI in practice are evaluated from its trialling on LMS data drawn from a large users' database (75 professors and 1037 students), referring to a five-course b-learning process of 51 weeks at a HEI. Experimental results have shown that the proposed FuzzyQoI model efficiently identified (dis)similarities in LMS interaction trends, correlations, distributions and dependencies with the time-period of the LMS use, both for the user-dependent and user-independent (group-like) cases. Consequently, the proposed FuzzyQoI functions as a means for better understanding and explaining the nature of underlying aspects, which influence the users' interaction behaviour under the LMS-based b-learning approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On-line discussion forums constitute communities of people learning from each other, which not only inform the students about their peers' doubts and problems but can also inform instructors about their students' knowledge of the course contents. In fact, nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students' final performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classification algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle's module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a first-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classification algorithms have been used and compared versus classification via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a final prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classification for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students' messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classification accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines the introduction of new online technologies to support distance language learning in a higher education institution in the UK, charting the development from using telephone conferencing in the 1990s to the implementation of Moodle and videoconferencing more recently. It uses the sociocultural concept of the learner-context interface to emphasise the centrality of both learners and context in the design and delivery of technology-supported language courses rather than making the development of computer-mediated learning opportunities the main focus. Building on research and evaluation work carried out over more than 15 years, the authors of this article analyse the issues that have arisen and that have affected change regarding technology and pedagogy. Central areas of investigation in terms of the learners were found to be interaction, learning communities, metacognition, literacy, affect and learner support; in terms of context they include task design, teacher roles and teacher skills. In the conclusion, limitations of the research and new developments are outlined. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Background: Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies. Objective: We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET's content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues. Methods: Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students' attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013. Results: In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends. Conclusions: The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors). © Daniel Schwarz, Petr Štourač, Martin Komenda, Hana Harazim, Martina Kosinová, Jakub Gregor, Richard Hůlek, Olga Smékalová , Ivo Křikava, Roman Štoudek, Ladislav Dušek.

The aim of this article is to identify the relationships and synergies between two basic management skills - teamwork and leadership - in the virtual learning environment of a master's degree programme subject, whose purpose, among other things, is to enable students to acquire both competencies. A two-fold methodology was used: first, a qualitative analysis of a student survey specifically designed to gain an insight into teamwork and leadership practices; and second, a quantitative analysis of Moodle activity logs for each member of every team's use of communication spaces and methods (forums and chats). The results obtained from both analyses showed that the dynamics varied considerably from team to team; that there was a clear relationship between teamwork, leadership management and participation, and each group's performance; and that groups with a clear leader from the start obtained better results. © Ana R.

In formal education, a majority of e-learning courses is still conducted in a learning management system (LMS). Teachers and authors of educational resources can make use of context-aware recommender systems, which would recommend relevant learning objects to be included in the course. Context data can be obtained, among other sources, from an existing learning environment. This paper describes a two-phase survey of four LMSs - Chamilo, Claroline, Ilias and Moodle - and their characteristics suitable for creating an LMS part of a context model, which would be relevant to implement in recommender systems for this purpose. A sample set of use cases is given, which describes how teachers and content authors could use the system. Based on the survey results, a set of context model dimensions is proposed.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) offer new approaches towards knowledge acquisition and collaboration through distance learning processes. Web-based Learning Management Systems (LMS) have transformed the way that education is conducted nowadays. At the same time, the adoption of Virtual Worlds in the educational process is of great importance, not only for the researchers in the field of Web-based Education, but also for the educational community that is interested in applying ICT in education. The main motivation for studying the potential of Virtual Worlds applications in education stems from the capabilities they offer to create a cyberspace where users can interact with other participants (through their avatars) or objects, creating new experiences that are not often feasible in the real world. Within this context, the fundamentals of learning theories have to be analyzed, in order to study their impact on e-learning and Virtual Learning Environments design. The currently available Virtual-World platforms are being presented and qualitatively assessed. Subsequently we focus on Sloodle, which bridges the characteristics of the Moodle LMS with the Open Simulator 3D virtual world functionality. © ACPIL.

Background and Objective: The guidelines of the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM) on frequent and important reasons for encounter in Primary Care play a central role in the teaching of Family Medicine. They were edited by the authors into an app for mobile phones, making them available at all times to General Practitioners and medical students. This study examines the issue: how useful do students consider this application within their learning process in Family Medicine? Method: The short versions of the 15 DEGAM guidelines were processed as a web app (for all smartphone software systems) including offline utilisation, and offered to students in the Family Medicine course, during clinical attachments in General Practice, on elective compulsory courses or for their final year rotation in General Practice. The evaluation was made with a structured survey using the feedback function of the Moodle learning management system [http://www.elearning-allgemeinmedizin.de] with Likert scales and free-text comments. Results: Feedback for evaluation came from 14 (25%) of the student testers from the Family Medicine course (9), the clinical attachment in General Practice (1), the final year rotation in General Practice (1) and elective compulsory courses (4). Students rated the app as an additional benefit to the printed/pdf-form. They use it frequently and successfully during waiting periods and before, during, or after lectures. In addition to general interest and a desire to become acquainted with the guidelines and to learn, the app is consulted with regard to general (theoretical) questions, rather than in connection with contact with patients. Interest in and knowledge of the guidelines is stimulated by the app, and on the whole the application can be said to be well suited to the needs of this user group. Discussion: The students evaluated the guidelines app positively: as a modern way of familiarising them with the guidelines and expanding their knowledge, particularly through its use in waiting periods and the attractive medium smartphone. However, the latter prevents a mandatory curricular use in compulsory courses, since not all students use smartphones. It is a meaningful addition to existing teaching materials and supports evidence-based teaching in Family Medicine and is suitable for use not only in university course teaching but also during clinical training. © 2013 Waldmann et al.

There are many reasons why online self-management education is attractive to both patients and providers. AsthmaWise, an online self-management program, was developed using a Moodle platform, to enable older adults to learn asthma selfmanagement skills. This study aimed to improve AsthmaWise through conducting: usability testing with a sample of end users; a cognitive walk-through undertaken by an independent health researcher; and assessment of content readability. A Perceived Health Web Site Usability Questionnaire score of 67% was achieved, indicating that there were usability issues that needed to be addressed. The cognitivewalk-through and readability assessment identified unique issues that were not identified through usability testing with end users. The testing process allowed issues to be identified and rectified before piloting AsthmaWise, creating a more accessible and refined end product. The involvement of the site designer in the testing process was valuable and is highly recommended. This study shows that usability testing involving both end users and experts is an essential part of the design process that is relatively easy and inexpensive to undertake and can be effectively conducted by a nonexpert.

This article describes the transition from a traditional instructor-centered course, based on lectures, to a student-centered course based on active learning methodologies as part of the reform of the Spanish higher education system within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Specifically, we describe the use of active learning methodologies to teach metabolism to students of nutrition and dietetics during the first year of their professional training in a 4-year undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Human Nutrition and Dietetics). In the new course design, the number of didactic lectures was largely reduced and complemented with a series of activities (problems/case studies, discussion workshops, self-assessment quizzes) aimed to get students actively engaged, to encourage self-learning, and to promote sustained work throughout the length of the course. The article presents quantitative data demonstrating a clear and significant improvement in students' performance when an active approach was implemented. Importantly, the improved performance was achieved without work overload. Finally, students' responses to this new teaching methodology have been very positive and overall satisfaction high. In summary, our results strongly argue in favor of the teaching model described herein. © 2013 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Purpose: The major objective of this paper is to develop holistic e-content for postgraduate students for library and information science with an aim to benefit the learners about and beyond a syllabus. The objectives of the initiative are: develop e-content in library and information science subject at postgraduate level drawing expertise from subject experts in colleges, universities and R and D libraries; impart training to subject experts in the process of e-content creation; make e-content available to students and peers using different delivery modes to impart formal and informal education and for supplementing and complementing the process of teaching and learning; and promote usage of e-content amongst students and peers and teachers in library and information science. Design/methodology/approach: Moodle software (www.moodle.org) and GSDL (www.greenstone.org) were downloaded and installed. Moodle was used as front end layer and GSDL was in back end layer as a backend repository system. The front end layer consists of Moodle as an application system and Mysql as a storage RDBMS system, and the business layer deals with managing access restriction, online socialization, knowledge construction/organization, and development. Various committees were formed for paper coordinators, content writers, content reviewers and language editors. Findings: It has been observed that the converged framework would facilitate converged and improved global standards in the field of academics with LIS education being no exception. Thus, on the basis of the critical evaluation of the currently available online LIS courses offered by different universities and institutes, a framework has been proposed for possible use to develop an online LIS course in Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University, Nagpur. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual model to develop the e-learning environment in a Department of Library and Information Science. This study will be helpful to all who want to develop and implement e-learning courses in LIS. Practical implications: Practically it is possible to develop the e-learning model for DLISc, RTM Nagpur University, Nagpur by integrating the two open source softwares (i.e. Moodle and GSDL). Social implications: If the model were developed and used with a proper planning and execution stage, it would definitely be helpful for the learning purposes of the students as well as for the faculty members. Originality/value: This is a conceptual model that could be applied to any university LIS department. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper proposes the application of association rule mining to improve quizzes and courses. First, the paper shows how to preprocess quiz data and how to create several data matrices for use in the process of knowledge discovery. Next, the proposed algorithm that uses grammar-guided genetic programming is described and compared with both classical and recent soft-computing association rule mining algorithms. Then, different objective and subjective rule evaluation measures are used to select the most interesting and useful rules. Experiments have been carried out by using real data of university students enrolled on an artificial intelligence practice Moodle's course on the CLIPS programming language. Some examples of these rules are shown, together with the feedback that they provide to instructors making decisions about how to improve quizzes and courses. Finally, starting with the information provided by the rules, the CLIPS quiz and course have been updated. These innovations have been evaluated by comparing the performance achieved by students before and after applying the changes using one control group and two different experimental groups. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.

The contribution deals with the principles of programmed learning, specifically with implementing a new module to Learning Management System Moodle. This study activity allows the construction of a new question type. If a student does not answer correctly, the main question is substituted by a set of easier sub-questions. The order of these sub-questions is set by means of question maps suggested by the teacher. All processes related to displaying, answering and evaluating the questions are managed by the Moodle question-answering system. The paper briefly introduces the principles of programmed learning and it describes the method of branch learning that is used in the module implementation. Next the methods and the used tools for the module implementation are presented. The question map as a core of the module is explained, its function is described and the cooperation with the question bank is clarified. The use of the module is explained in a simple example. To simplify the process of question generation and the set of sub-questions with the same entry data, a specific automatic generator of questions is applied. Next the principle of this automatic generator of question is introduced, the example of generation process is presented and some results of generation are depicted. Finally the results of the new module tested by users are discussed and in the conclusion other possible features of the module are proposed in relation to the process of question generation and to the work with the generated questions along with the discussion of few patents. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

Web 2.0 tools have gained strategic importance in personal, social and educational contexts. In this study, we analysed the use made by 757 Spanish students of 10 Web 2.0 tools, namely wikis, blogs, Moodle, Google Docs, Google Reader, Google Maps, Skype, Flickr, YouTube and general or personal social networks. To this end, we administered an online questionnaire, the HEWE2.0, designed using the Google Docs application, to explore five questions: (i) what information, knowledge and training the subjects had, (ii) how they used the tools: difficulty, preference and satisfaction, (iii) when and where they used them, (iv) why they had begun to use them, and (v) what they used them for. We performed two types of analysis, one descriptive and the other multivariate, using the General Linear Model. The results show specific patterns of response according to sex, educational level and age. We found that female subjects showed a greater preference for social tools than males, who preferred instrumental tools; that the higher the subjects' educational level, the more information they possessed about Web 2.0 tools; and that functional knowledge about those tools requiring greater digital competence increased with age and vice versa. The implications of these results are discussed and evaluated. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The use of Information and Communication Technologies in higher education has proved to be very effective in different educational environments. A less explored area is their application for evaluation on-line, since it is a different process, with specific components. This work describes a methodology that combines the assessment with multiple choice tests through the virtual environment Moodle and the evaluation by using traditional classroom exams. The proposed mixed methodology ELFF (E-Learning and Face to Face) was implemented during the academic year 2010-2011 in the subject Microeconomics: Markets and Competition in the European Union of the double degree in Law and in Business Administration and Management, to assess complementary aspects of the knowledge acquired. The obtained results show that it clearly promotes the participation of students, increases their motivation and improves their competence and so, their performance in terms of qualifications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) provide the opportunity to deliver blended learning approaches that combine mixes of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with various delivery methods and media. In 2008 and 2009, the University of Winchester in the UK redesigned a variety of accounting and financial management modules for presentation in a blended learning environment. An exploratory, qualitative case study investigated students' perceptions of the new approach. Through focus groups, students reported favourably on the blended learning approach and the views of students correlated with previous research, although there were some contrary findings. Focus groups raised issues concerning students' expectations, competence and engagement. Resources and institutional practices were identified as factors in students' attitudes towards blended learning. Issues about communication, student interaction and collaboration also emerged. Finally, some practical lessons from this case study are proposed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Critical thinking (CT) and English communication are recognized as two essential 21st century competencies. To equip students with these competencies and respond to the challenges of global competition, educational technology is being developed to enhance teaching and learning. This study examined the effectiveness of integrating CT into individualized English listening and speaking instruction using Moodle, a virtual learning environment. Individualized instruction was designed with three key elements, namely proficiency level grouping, individualized instructional strategies and materials, and individualized feedback. Participants were 83 students enrolled in a semester-long general education course at a large university in Taiwan. The four dependent measures were CT skills (CTS), CT dispositions (CTD), English listening, and speaking proficiency. Results from the one-group pretest-posttest design were evaluated by paired t-tests and a mixed design ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) in order to identify any statistically significant improvements following the intervention. The results of the study showed that learners participating in the treatment significantly improved in terms of English listening and speaking, as well as on all CTS subscales, with little change in CTD, apart from significant improvement on the subscale of open-mindedness. Limitations and suggestions for successful online CT-integrated instruction and implications for future research are provided. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of e-learning, as a pedagogical tool, for changing initial conceptions when learning about physics by using the learning management System of the Moodle platform. Our study provides an empirical exploration of the pedagogical use of Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) in order to investigate a) the change of students' conception of fundamental issues in electricity and b) their attitudes towards the use of this LMS system. Analysis of questionnaire data shows a slight improvement in students' performance and this difference is associated with participants' conceptual understanding. Students had strong attitudes towards blended learning but this was not reflected upon their intention to further use the LMS, as expressed in responses to the TAM's questionnaire. © 2013 by ESER, Eurasian Society of Educational Research.

This paper describes TrivialCV, a toolkit created to facilitate the management of team-based competitive activities within the classroom. TrivialCV was designed as an instructororiented tool, in order to foster the organization of these types of innovative activities by facilitating the instructor's task. This goal is achieved by providing easy-to-use graphical tools and a kit of integration services that allow TrivialCV to be integrated with popular e-learning tools (e.g. Moodle-based environments). Integration is achieved by using an extensible plugin that can be generalized to support different e-Learning tools and even different external activities. The article describes the general architecture designed to integrate TrivialCV with different e-learning tools, and the specific implementation developed to integrate it with the Virtual Campus at the Complutense University (based in Moodle v1.9). © 2013 IEEE.

This article discusses a two-year telecollaborative project in teacher education that took an integrated approach to teaching about and through technological resources in order to introduce student-teachers to innovative methods for communicative-based language learning through computer-mediated communication (CMC). Via 'technological immersion', student-teachers in two groups in Spain and the US were required to work together online to give peer feedback and evaluation of several activities, including teaching sequences. They also co-created podcasts, along with accompanying educational activities. Some of the tools used were Moodle, Skype, emails, wikis, Second Life and podcasting. The article analyzes and discusses multimodal data collected during the collaboration. Results indicate that the online collaboration enhanced teacher development through opportunities unavailable in more traditional teacher education classrooms and enabled student-teachers to better make connections between theory and practice.

E-learning as the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet is widely used to improve the quality of learning. This leads to improved quality of the pupils' and students' learning approach. The research aim is to create e-learning courses with a thematic focus on the climate and its change consisting accurate information from the field of climate change and environment. The main objective of the courses is to provide educational materials to various groups of users, focusing on natural and social sciences related to the climate change. During the creation of e-learning courses the authors faced the following problem: the e-learning system they used, Moodle, did not include any modules for work with maps or geodata. Their solution is based on the LMS Moodle and thin client which was created with the use of ArcGIS Server. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

The learning management systems (LMS) facility has become an essential tool in teaching and learning processes for higher education, since this tool assists students and lecturers to interact, communicate, collaborate, and corporate, and this can lead to cultivating and improving students' communication skills. Currently, the majority of universities nationally and internationally are using LMS (Blackboard and Moodle) for uploading unit materials, including assessment tasks. This study will assess LMS from a different angle by examining lecturers' and students' attitudes to it as a means of submitting assessment tasks with the traditional method. Using the LMS facility for the submission of assessment tasks can assist students as well lecturers to reduce the amount of materials being used (such as paper) and preserve resources; moreover, the cost of binding and delivery will be reduced or eliminated since all submissions are made automatically. This study provides an answer to the question "Do assessment tasks submissions made via learning management systems (LMS) and email increase sustainability awareness among Information Systems students in Portugal and Australia?" The answer was obtained through informal student feedback (N=63) containing quantitative and qualitative data. The findings indicated that a win-win situation is created since lecturers are delighted that e-learning sustainability principles are being successfully promoted in their teaching and learning approaches, since all communications between students are established via email, blackboard and Moodle forums. Furthermore, the research study confirmed that the uploading of assessment tasks via LMS and email facilities is easier, inexpensive, convenient and less time-consuming compared with the traditional methods of submission and feedback. In addition, this method is more sustainable (as fewer materials are used), practical and cheaper, as these principles are aligned with those of the Sustainability and E-learning (SeL) Model. © Common Ground, Pedro Isaias, Tomayess Issa.

Adult learners often fear that they will be unable to find work if they are lacking in technological skills. The media, including newspapers, magazines, and advertisements for positions often emphasize the importance of the use of technology in the workplace. It is the case that without adequate skills in the use of appropriate technologies, adult workers may face challenges in finding employment. But what technologies can do is to provide powerful teaching and learning strategies. This article addresses technological applications in vocational and adult education advancement from different perspectives. Technology has the potential to support transformative learning. Technology, along with the vital role of adult educators, helps learners grow, change, and develop. Through the discussion of these, and related issues, a model titled Learners' Seeking Transformation via Web 2.0 Technologies, has emerged. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

Knowing whether Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) could transfer Web 2.0 affordances, which have been focused on the non-educational or recreational sphere, to the institutional sphere is important to move the research agenda beyond "cool uses" and to understand how the learning process is affected when students use this new type of environment in formal settings. This study analyzes the use of institutionally-powered PLEs (iPLEs) as a means to enable the participatory and community-centered model of Web 2.0 in higher education. Students from two undergraduate, inter-university, online courses were divided into two groups: a control group using a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) based on Moodle, and an experimental group using an iPLE based on iGoogle, FriendFeed and Google Groups. The assumption that the iPLE is a suitable tool to create a cohesive and participative learning network that excels that generated by means of the VLE was explored. The results obtained through social network analysis performed to each environment's forum data confirm this hypothesis. © 2013, IGI Global.

The role of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) is very important when conducting educational activities, specially in the case of distant education - when its use becomes essential since all the interactions among the participants in the learning/teaching process are conducted through it. There are a number tools to provide this functionality, both open-source (such as, LRN, Sakai, or Moodle) and proprietary solutions (such as Blackboard). Given the wide variety of existing LMSs, it is worthwhile to devote effort in order to figure out which LMS is the most suitable for my needs? This paper strives at answering this question by presenting a twofold evaluation that compares three of the most widely used open-source LMS, namely. LRN, Sakai, and Moodle. First, a performance evaluation is presented that shows the different levels of use of the hardware resources (e.g. CPU, memory, I/O) of the machine the LMS is running on. Second, a performance evaluation from the point of view of the system administrators is also presented.

USALSIM was developed by the University of Salamanca (USAL) as a response to the policy changes of learning and work placements in the new European Space for Higher Education. USALSIM makes it possible to face the increase of the number of students who will participate in the different university work placement programs and the increasing number of companies and institutions necessary to host and train theses students. This project used a 3D virtual environment (a work placement simulator) that allows developing a virtual representation of different work environments. Representing a professional work space such as a laboratory, for example, the student can simulate common tasks through active learning. This virtual world is focused on a constructive pedagogy, where students are directly involved in their formative development, establishing professional relationships, developing transversal and technical competencies and evaluating their knowledge.

Online tools, such as forums, wikis, and blogs lend themselves to learners negotiating meaning and co-constructing knowledge through interaction. However, not enough is known about how tasks need to be designed to make best use of the possibilities of complex virtual learning environments (VLEs) to motivate and support learners, foster interaction, and contribute to knowledge construction. This article reports on a two-year study exploring the design and implementation cycle of online activities as an integral part of a distance language course. When the course was introduced in 2009, activities had been designed on the basis of second language acquisition principles as well as sociocultural theories, providing a basis for student interaction and taking into account the affordances of the environment, a Moodle-based VLE. After the end of the first year an evaluation was carried out that examined quantitative and qualitative data (Moodle user logs, learner surveys and learner interviews). It was found that students preferred forums to other tools and that assessment-related activities attracted higher participation rates than other tasks. It also highlighted a number of issues, including low participation in on-task discussions, a large gap between viewings and contributions, very large differences in individual engagement, low priority given to the online activities by some students, and varying levels of e-literacy amongst learners. Consequently, activities were re-designed and a number of changes were implemented in 2010 that included more teacher involvement, fewer tasks, a simpler structure, and a reduced number of tools. A comparison of learner participation across the two years shows that these changes had a positive impact on learner engagement. © 2013, Equinox Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electronic learning is the future learning that delivers comprehensive contents to students in comfortable time and conditions chosen by learners needs. Faculty members and expert engineers helping them in using recent technologies and to stay informed about the latest developments, and transfer what they have learned to new generations of students. Aim of this study was: To establish electronic gate to Alexandria Faculty of Medicine as an alternative or complementary method for teaching both postgraduates and undergraduate medical students. To enhance faculty members and student levels of skills toward integrating e-learning in their teaching. Design: 3 years Cross sectional descriptive and applied analytical study was used in this study. Subjects: 150 Staff faculty members, 150 postgraduate students as well as 1200 undergraduate medical students were involved in the study. Tools: First year (2010) was stressed on training staff members on online courses by weekly lectures and regular workshops. Second year (2011) was dedicated in creating and applying 21 postgraduate academic and clinical medical on line courses. Third year(2012) was concentrated on online regular exams for 4th, 5th, and 6th medical students together with reapplying postgraduate e-courses after their modification by following the feedback from previous courses. A structured questionnaire was developed by the researchers in four parts: Part one included information of participants experience in teaching using recent technologies. Part two included participant's attitudes on the usefulness of recent technology. Part three included participant's (students and professors) supporting electronic learning. Part four feedback (survey) questioner' prepared by technical support and submitted by postgraduate students after each e-course. Lastly an e-course comprehensive contents with was prepared by team of staff members (Professors, Assistants, Lecturers and Demonstrators) in the form of power points, video films, animations, weekly activity(either quiz or assignment) for totally 40 marks i.e. continuous assessment, midterm quiz at 7th week for 20 marks and a final on line exam.at the 15th week for the rest 40%.The on line exams were in the form of multiple choices, true or false and matching. All the resources (contents), quizzes and e-exams were prepared and uploaded by Medical Staff Members with assistance of Technical Support Engineers(Electronic unit team). Our results revealed a high rate of willingness of students(80%) and staff (60%)to use electronic teaching and exams. in terms of convenience, simplicity and saving money of transport and working at the same time of studying (postgraduates more than undergraduates who still need face to face teaching).

Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre-and posttest questionnaires and from tracking studentnavigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach. © 2012 The American Physiological Society.

This paper shows the integration of social network services into the educational process. The main goal of this paper is the improvement of quality of e-education process through encouraging communication, collaboration and interaction between students and teachers. Students' motivation for involvement in the educational process can be fostered by using Facebook services within the e-education portal. The proposed model of the Facebook services influence on the quality of e-education is based on the analysis of students' attitudes toward e-education, on their achievement and on tracking the web site traffic. The results of the analysis have shown that students who used Facebook for educational purposes had better achievement in comparison with those who used it for fun.

There has been a vast debate in recent years about usage patterns of social computing and Web 2.0 tools in learning contexts. A growing number of researchers suggest that certain pedagogical approaches are best suited in these contexts, since they involve active engagement, social learning, continuous feedback, enabling students' autonomous understanding and the transfer of those skills to useful or real-life settings. In this article we present the use of a social network as part of a formal course of Management at the University of Pisa. The institutional VLE - based on Moodle - has been integrated with a student support group hosted on Ning. Problems and opportunities for using Ning have been discussed in small groups and students feedback will be reported. The shift from learning management system (course centric) to a personal learning environment (people centric) and then to personal learning network is also been discussed and a framework is provided.

Blended learning combines multiple delivery media that are designed to complement each other and promote learning and application-learned behavior (Smith&Dillon, 1999). This article re-ports on a study conducted in the College of Information Technology to evaluate levels of stu-dent' satisfaction with blended learning. The particular blend of learning modalities used at the college combines an equal balance of traditional face-to-face and videoconference learning, com-plemented with the use of a learning management system (Moodle). Recently, discussions of blended learning have begun to examine the benefits derived from learn-ing situations characterized by face-to-face education and mixed modalities of instruction. Re-gardless of comparisons made by researchers and developers, those studying blended learning have agreed that student satisfaction is a baseline requirement for successful implementation. Student satisfaction is considered an important factor in measuring the quality of blended learn-ing. It results from a combination of factors. In this study a model is proposed by the aggregation of these factors into five groups: instructor, technology, class management, interaction, and in-struction. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an instrument that can be used to measure perceived student satisfaction with blended learning and explore whether satisfaction differs according to gender. The results indicate that the Student Satisfaction Survey Forms (SSSF) used were a valid measure of student satisfaction. They also show that students were sat-isfied with all components, although the level of satisfaction varied according to gender. © Informing Science Institute.

Social Networking has been a global consumer phenomenon during the last few years. Online communities are changing the way people behave, share and interact within their daily lives. Most of such communities are mainly focused on sharing contents and communicating using a traditional web interface. However, social virtual worlds are computersimulated environments that the users can "inhabit" and in which they can interact and create objects. Education is one of the most interesting applications of virtual worlds, as their flexibility can be exploited in order to create heterogeneous groups from all over the world who can collaborate synchronously in different virtual spaces. In this paper, we highlight the potential of virtual worlds as an educative tool and propose a model to create learning environments within Second Life or OpenSimulator combining the Moodle learning management system, embodied conversational metabots, and programmable 3D objects. We have implemented the proposal in a learning system for several subjects of the Computer Science degree in our university and show that it fostered engagement and collaboration and helped the students to better understand complex concepts. © J.UCS.

The use of Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) is a trend topic in virtual education and e-learning. A number of research papers and literature reviews addresses how digital natives learn in a different way than the previous generation and how these kinds of highly interactive environments may positively affect their motivation. But actual efficacy of MUVEs to enhance students' motivation has not been deeply backed up yet by empirical research. This paper contributes with a small experiment conducted on an elective programming course for engineering students. The hypothesis was that the use of a MUVE would improve students' motivation towards learning. To evaluate the veracity of this hypothesis, the dropout rates of the course were compared alongside four academic years, assuming that lower dropout rates imply a motivation increase. The first two years (Y1 and Y2) a traditional approach based on lectures, weekly assignments and a final exam was used. The last two years (Y3 and Y4), the NUCLEO approach was used. NUCLEO is a pedagogical strategy that combines game mechanics (including collaboration and competition), problembased learning and a fantastic narrative metaphor. In Y3 the NUCLEO approach was implemented having a flat classical interface provided by the standard Moodle Learning Management System (LMS), while in Y4 a ·3D MUVE was used as interface. Dropouts during the traditional teaching period (Y1-2) fell dramatically during the NUCLEO teaching period (Y3-4). However, dropouts were higher in Y4 when a MUVE was used as interface (16.66%) compared to Y3 (9.09%). These data suggest that just using a MUVE or a 3D environment can enhance motivation but to achieve maximum effectiveness if they are combined with elements like game mechanics. These data were also backed up by satisfaction questionnaires fulfilled by teachers and students. © J.UCS.

The current study reports on the use of Wiki as an online didactic tool to develop knowledge management (KM) processes in higher education. This study integrates social constructivist principles to learning where learners are pro-active and collaborative through higher order cognitive processes. The study was administered in two countries, namely Egypt and Italy, to close a gap in the literature with an aim to introduce KM processes in teacher educational programmes. These processes are seen as necessary for teachers' professional skills. Such processes are claimed to enable teachers and therefore schools to evolve in a networked information-driven global society, especially as the complexity of subject knowledge is increasing. It is also a learning experience where teachers learn how to provide their students with educational settings where technology is enabled. Throughout the study, 27 Egyptian students and 36 Italian students participated in online activities and developed interdisciplinary projects for the primary and preparatory stages while collaborating in a Wiki experience within Moodle platform. The study followed a mixed methods approach that consisted of both quantitative and qualitative data. The authors developed several instruments in order to measure both processes and outcomes of the five-week online activities. This current study is reporting on the use of two closed question instruments and one open question instrument. These were: Knowledge Management Questionnaire (KMQ), Student Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ) and a Reflection Questionnaire (RQ). Data were analysed using statistical analysis and inductive content analysis. Results indicate that responses on the KMQ were all reliable >0.70, and fulfilled the five processes of KM and participants were highly satisfied. The results suggest that Wikis can develop teachers' knowledge management processes and fulfil student's satisfaction while collaborating in designing interdisciplinary projects. Future implications and suggestions for teacher education programmes are provided in light of the findings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The authors present a learning platform based on a computer game. Learning games combine two industries: education and entertainment, which is often called "Edutainment." The game is realized as a strategic game (similar to Risk™), implemented as a module for Moodle CMS, utilizing Java Applet technology. Moodle is an open-source course management system (CMS), which is widely used among universities as an eLearning platform. Java Applet enables development of rich-client applications which are executed in web browser environment. During the game, players receive questions from specified Moodle quiz, and all answers are stored back into Moodle system. Students can later verify their score and answers, and examine the test that they actually worked on during the game. This system supports synchronous as well as asynchronous interaction between players. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

The medical education literature is growing, and the result is not only greater knowledge, but an increasing complexity in locating quality evidence-based information. In 2008, eight librarians partnered with the Association of American Medical Colleges to research, conceptualize, and build an online module to develop medical educators' search skills. Developing an online instructional module is a time-consuming, multi-stage process requiring the expertise of content, technical, and design specialists working in concert. Many lessons were learned, including the power of collaborative tools; the benefits of including specialists, such as graphic designers; the benefit of thoroughly surveying existing resources; and the importance of choosing technology wisely. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

This article outlines a set of features that wiki engines require to successfully host collaborative educational scenarios. The authors explore multiple issues that deal with the use wikis with learning activities. One of the first issues to solve is software support for assessment methodologies. The second is choosing between using an integrated wiki engine inside the Learning Management System (LMS) or an external standalone wiki engine. Advantages and disadvantages from both options of this second issue are discussed. The different implications of each option as far as individual student assessment, feedback, and grading are concerned are also analyzed. Among the expected results, the most notable are incentives to incorporate wikis in the teaching process, significant enhancements in usability, as well as allowing teachers to provide more timely written feedback on their students' individual contributions on wiki based activities, on top of the usual numerical grading. This paper presents the conclusions of 5 years of experience of work in the field of wikis in education, development of improvements on open source wiki engines and thus, building from scratch accordingly the new wiki engine for the LMS Moodle 2.0.

An E-Portfolio is a digital collection of works, artifacts, resources, including demonstrations, projects, art works in form of graphics (2D, 3D), accomplishments that represent a student's work. The concept of e-portfolio has been derived from the traditional portfolios. From a pedagogical viewpoint, the portfolio was meant to improve the assessment process by bringing out and revealing a range of skills and understandings one student's parts; support instructional goals; reflect change and growth over a period of time; encourage student, teacher, and parent reflection; and provide for continuity in education from one year to the next. Naturally, the portfolio had to be transformed to EPortfolio, so as to survive the tough demand and rigid requirements of the examining bodies and also the job market. But has the e-portfolio been able to reflect the same pedagogical viewpoint from its parent portfolio? Many people have come up with various concepts and models of e-portfolio in the education sector, and several systems have been set up to evaluate the student at different stages. Yet, these systems have failed to capture student perspectives. The main rationale of the study is to propose a learning design specification for an innovative e-portfolio module that will be used in the Moodle e-learning environment of the University of Mauritius. One of the aspects of this research will be to give E-Portfolio a right structure for the moodle system. Hence, a need to come up with a global eportfolio which is customizable to meet specific needs and at the same time retaining the pedagogical structure. The aim of this paper is to present the first part of the study; that is to come up with a conceptual proposal of the new E-portfolio system, excluding the technicalities and data collection. © Common Ground, Girish Mautadin, Mohammad Issack Santally, Ravindra Boojhawon.

Based on Competence Motivation Theory (CMT), a Moodle course for schoolchildren's table tennis learning was developed (The URL is http://www.bssepp.com.; this course allows guest access). The effects of the course on students' knowledge, perceived competence and interest were evaluated through quantitative methods. The sample of the study consisted of 32 primary school students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the Moodle course (Group M, N = 16) and the other one (Group C, N = 16) didn't.; the intervention lasted 6 weeks. The result showed that (1) students made significant learning gains and demonstrated statistically significant higher perceived competence by participating in the Moodle course, (2) there was no statistically significant mean difference in table tennis interest between the two intervention groups. These positive effects on knowledge and perceived competence suggest that Moodle can be used as a tool to supplement traditional motor learning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The classical teaching-learning environments have dramatically changed, which is marked by the buzzword of atypical modes of learning. The changed learning environment related to these modes of learning can be characterized by the powerful support of ICT. In our present fast-transforming world the new layers of the information society are forming in the environment of the most uptodate tools, consequently these layers can be called digital natives. They are familiar with IPTV, intelligent mobile phones and homes, 3D TV, IPv6 network, thin client terminals, social networks (facebook, twitter, hi5, linkedln) and the web 3.0 protocolls. The paper gives an insight into the world of new learning theories characterized by technical integration, networking, realizing knowledge construction instead of knowledge transfer. The author focuses ont he connectivist characteristics based ont he most prevailing technology-based learning as a consequence of his practical experience acquired in higher education, where learning occurs in a social environment by means of the interactions (cooperation, collaboration) of networked learning communities.

In this paper, we describe an approach to providing adaptivity in e-education courses. The primary goal of the paper is to enhance an existing e-education system, namely Moodle LMS, by developing a method for creating adaptive courses, and to compare its effectiveness with non-adaptive education approach. First, we defined the basic requirements of a course adaptation and the steps required to implement it. Based on the collected data, we identified the characteristic groups of students and then classified all participating students into these groups. The final adaptation of courses was performed in the distance education system of the University of Belgrade, in the Laboratory for e-business, Faculty of Organizational Sciences. Findings of the experimental study showed that the students' effectiveness and achievements in learning were higher when they attended courses adapted using the described method, in comparison to the non-adaptive e-learning courses.

IN THE LAST decade, the Creative Commons philosophy of freely sharing information and the pervasiveness of the Internet have created many new opportunities for teaching and learning. MIT OpenCourseWare spearheaded the sharing of high-quality, university-level courses. While these materials were not originally designed for individuals engaged in self-study, approximately half of OCW's traffic is from these users. 6 Recently the use of learning management systems (LMSs), such as the proprietary Blackboard or open-source Moodle software, has become ubiquitous. © 2012 ACM.

We had an Interpersonal Relationships course, a large class, around fifty students, working collaboratively in groups where students from different degrees, academic years, and ages, most of them deaf, tried, and to some extent were able, to communicate. We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and how learning management systems can act as mediators to overcome the challenges of diversity and the barriers of emotional isolation. We were carrying out a participatory action research project, within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle, to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We were using content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, of the reflective descriptions of the classes, of the students' e-portfolios, and of the interviews with the students. The paper describes how, in the context of this project, we have discovered that a learning management systems can be a powerful mediator in promoting the inclusion of deaf students and in establishing emotional bridges across gaps that face-to-face environments are sometimes unable to span. ©Academic Publishing International Ltd.

The aim of this study was to identify learners' perceptions of the quality of interaction in Moodle and investigate the effects of gender, grade point average (GPA), individualized learning experiences and their experiences in using Moodle factors in perceiving the quality of interaction. A questionnaire was used to collect data after being validated. It was distributed to 57 undergraduate students. Results show that students perceived the quality of interaction positively and that there were no significant differences in the means for the four variables dealt with in this study which means that the wide diffusion of computers into educational fields and into the society at large in the last few years enabled students to develop more positive perceptions of information technology applications independent from their basic individual differences such as gender, GPA, computer experience, and individualized learning experience. In terms of ranking of interaction types learners show that their interaction with themselves comes in first, then with the instructors and finally with content. The study recommends that higher education institutions should continue using Moodle and encourage faculty members to adopt it in their teaching because of its distinctive features.

The development in information technology has now moved from the first wave that emphasises on computer technical skills to the second wave which focuses on the application and management aspects This paper aims to investigate the use of learning management system among future school heads in education management and leadership. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase focused on developing a learning management system using open source software - Moodle. This phase emphasized on the processes involved in designing and developing the learning management system prototype called E-Headship. The second phase evaluated participants' suitability in becoming future school leaders and managers through the use of EHeadship for the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH) programme. E-Headship was then evaluated in terms of the applications of the learning management system. Sixty (60) participants from Institut Aminudin Baki (IAB) - an institute for training school administrators took part in the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistic focusing on reporting of the results in percentile, means, standard deviation and frequency. As it compared the performance results of two groups, a simple T-test was also performed. The results revealed that e-Headship has succeeded in promoting teaching and learning strategies to a higher degree. It is hoped that the use of such prototype will help the education institution in designing and developing better programmes that could benefit the participants at large. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

A small library using two full time equivalent (FTE) professional staff integrated into the Moodle environment of over 40 postgraduate distance courses with the potential to reach over 1,800 students and getting results. How? This is not embedding as many would think of it, with the librarian an active teacher throughout the entire length of the course. Through the use of reusable learning objects, and by working collaboratively with academic staff to place authentic information literacy development tasks at the point of need in the online environment, a small team has been able to make considerable in-roads into the postgraduate programs of the entire College in a short space of time. This paper outlines the model used, and how the librarians are using evaluation of outcomes to support evidence based library and information practice. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Bioethics learning has mainly being developed in classroom activities. Without pretending to substitute this classical face to face model, bioethics discipline, taught to first year students at day and night courses in Dentistry Department of Sao Paulo University, has been complemented by supervised visits to Department Clinics, as well as on line studies using Moodle platform. In this study students' records of discussion forums in Moodle platform in 2008 were evaluated to verify their perception about the proposal of supervised visits to clinical practice during their learning process. 71 of 100 students who published comments in discussion forums accepted to participate in the study. This is a qualitative study carried out by thematic content analysis. Students' perceptions about clinical practice allow professors to enhance their practice as pedagogical strategy for future classes and this may serve as model for other institutions.

This study investigated the effects of immediate feedback on computer- based foreign language listening comprehension tests and on intrapersonal test-associated anxiety in 72 English major college students at a Taiwanese University. Foreign language listening comprehension of computer-based tests designed by MOODLE,3 a dynamic e-learning environment, with or without immediate feedback together with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were tested and repeated after one week. The analysis indicated that immediate feedback during testing caused significantly higher anxiety and resulted in significantly higher listening scores than in the control group, which had no feedback. However, repeated feedback did not affect the test anxiety and listening scores. Computer-based immediate feedback did not lower debilitating effects of anxiety but enhanced students' intrapersonal eustress-like anxiety and probably improved their attention during listening tests. Computer-based tests with immediate feedback might help foreign language learners to increase attention in foreign language listening comprehension. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2012.

This article investigates the support e-learning can provide for the management and marking of assignments. The work is contextualised in the importance of assessment with assignments in tertiary education, in the theories about high quality marking of assignments, and the practical experiences of academics at tertiary institutions. The tasks that need to be carried out as part of assignment management and marking are detailed. A set of requirements is derived based on the education literature and on practical needs established in interviews with academics. Possible architectures for an e-learning system implementing these requirements are suggested and arguments are provided towards using an architecture that combines existing learning management system functionality for assignments with a specialised assignment management and marking application. A specific implementation based on Moodle and Lightwork is introduced. The article concludes with thoughts on the cognitive fit of learning management systems for assignment marking tasks and their core roles in supporting teaching and learning.

The advent of information technologies to Universities has improved the teaching-learning process. Students can increase their learning skills using information technology. Those using the Moodle platform regularly seem to get better grades than those who rarely or never use it. This paper analyzes students' intention to use Moodle platforms to improve the teaching-learning process. Its main focus is to analyze the use of the Moodle platform by University students, identifying factors which might influence the intention to use it. Understanding the factors influencing the intention to use Moodle will allow us to determine which actions might be carried out to boost its use by University students, to therefore, improve both their skills and grades. The theoretical grounding for this research is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM specifies the causal relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and actual usage behavior. The proposed model has six constructs and nine hypotheses have been generated from the connections between these six constructs. These constructs include perceived compatibility with student tasks, perceived usefulness for professors, and training. Our results provide support for a number of relationships in the hypothesized model. In light of these findings, implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Learning Management Systems (LMS) have become widespread among most centres for education and training. Being a mature technology, LMS have left the vanguard of innovation. Educational usages of the Web 2.0, Personal Learning Environments, Game-based Learning and particularly the introduction of mobile phones and tablets in education are happening outside the boundaries of the LMS. This paper proposes a way to integrate mobile devices and educational applications with the LMS through webservices; introducing the Moodbile project that provides an extension of Moodle 2.0 webservices for mobile integration and two mobile clients ready to use on real courses.

In this study we present an overview of the undergraduate blended Physics course that has been supported by the Moodle platform. The course that has been applied is a basic physics course for primary student teachers. The aim of Moodle is to create an online learning environment which helps students to have a virtual space where they can share knowledge through different kinds of supervised activities, chats and forums. Students have to enter Moodle and they have participated activities that have been offered by the instructor after the lesson every week. After the study, results have shown that teacher candidates using Moodle processing have positive thoughts about the course. In the study, it has been emphasized views of prospective primary teachers about MOODLE in some subjects of physics. Students are challenged to doing research. Prospective teachers tend to use this method in their professional life; therefore, it is recommend that offering challenging possibilities to them about their using. It is recommended that this application is become widespread in education (especially higher education in Turkey).

The emergence of e-learning tools such as Course Management Systems (CMS) offer instructors a practical means to transition from face-to-face to blended delivery modalities that could better serve the needs of digital learners. However, instructors fail to take advantage of such existing modern classroom technologies to provide better learning experiences for their learners. Part of this is due to the lack of a system to determine the underuse of technological tools in a CMS. This project focused on examining the degree of Moodle technology integration into course instruction to support effective student teaching and learning by three instructors. This article stimulates reflections on pedagogical experiences with regard to course content material and instructor practices. The study illustrates that instructors and learners can believe technology is being used well in a CMS course site when the opposite is true. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

UNEDLabs is a web portal based on a free, modern, open source, and well-known learning management system: Moodle. This portal joins two theme networks of virtual and remote laboratories (one for Control Engineering and another one for Physics, named AutomatL@bs and FisL@bs, respectively) together. AutomatL@bs has been operative for five years now. Following AutomatL@bs' scheme, FisL@bs was created as a network of remote and virtual laboratories for physics university education via the Internet to offer students the possibility of performing hands-on experiences in different fields of physics in two ways: simulation and real remote operation. Now, both FisL@bs and AutomatL@bs join together (while maintaining their independency) into an unique new web portal called UNEDLabs. This work focuses on this new web environment and gives a detailed account of a novel way in Physics to let distance learning students gain practical experience autonomously. This paper explains how the new portal works and the software tools used for creating it. In addition, it also describes the physics experiments which are already operative.

In the last decade, we have seen the emergence of virtual learning environments. Initially, these environments were a little more than document repositories that tutor used unicast to the students. Informed in part by social constructivist theories of education, later environments included capabilities for tutor-student and student-student, synchronous and asynchronous communication. The initial research of this paper reports the typical low usage of these capabilities. The main research attempted to ameliorate this problem by the provision of tools to promote a sense of social awareness as self-presence and copresence, and evaluation techniques to analyse e-learners' interactions. Data was obtained from prepost questionnaires, log files and social network analysis which augmented the data provided by the tools embedded in Moodle. The results indicate the importance of social awareness in effective e-learning; the quality of active participation can be increased by the use of associated tools. The e-tutor's role is still pivotal to facilitate and to support such engagement towards collaborative learning. Implications for future research suggest that social awareness tools and evaluation techniques can create awareness cues in an interface with a potential impact on learning. © 2011 The Authors.

Essays are a traditional component of the course requirements in many post-secondary courses. However, the practical and pedagogical disadvantages of essays are significant. These include the increasing ease with which essays can be plagiarized, the lack of peer involvement in the traditional essay submission and feedback process, the usual lack of meaningful instructor-student intellectual discourse in the essay development and feedback process, and the inability to include hyperlinks and non-text media in essays submitted on paper. It is suggested that as instructors make the transition from traditional to blended/online instruction, they consider jettisoning the traditional essay requirement and replace it with some form of "assignment essay/peer review" system such as the one described. Contemporary Learning Management Systems facilitate peer review and peer assessment approaches in ways that were not available in traditional offline education. This paper describes and discusses an online assignment system utilizing peer commentaries that addresses many of the shortcomings of these traditional essay requirement. The system is modeled after peer commentary academic journals such as Behavioral and Brain Sciences and Current Anthropology. This system has successfully been used as a substitute for the traditional essay requirement in a number of third year psychology course sections platformed on both Moodle and Blackboard. The advantages, challenges and practicalities of instituting, managing and grading such peer-reviewed assignments are outlined, and the benefits of the system in terms of student engagement, intellectual modeling, and learning community enhancement are discussed. The peer reviewed assignment system is discussed in the context of recent research indicating some advantages of blended learning approaches compared to traditional approaches. Criticisms of peer feedback approaches are examined, and instructors are encouraged to provide students with detailed instructions and criteria regarding the peer review process. It is hoped that the discussion will be particularly useful to instructors who are in the process of moving from traditional face-to-face course context to the blended/online education environment. ©Academic Publishing International Ltd.

WIRIS quizzes are an online mathematics tool for educational purposes that upgrade Moodle quizzes and allow the development of personalized quizzes using random data and conditional instructions. WIRIS quizzes can be used in any mathematics or science degree; their complex operators allow it to be used to solve electrical circuits. This tool promotes autonomous student learning and enables teachers to monitor that learning and make adjustments if necessary. Therefore, this tool improves teaching quality. It can also be used as an assessment tool by both the teacher and the student. This paper shows how WIRIS quizzes have been integrated into the virtual campus of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), Spain, to teach electrical circuits. Lessons learned in performing and using WIRIS quizzes with second-year students at the UPC are shown. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

Given the importance of formative assessment in the context of the European Higher Education Area, it is necessary to explore new tools to implement innovative strategies for the formative assessment of students. Moodle's quiz module represents an alternative to traditional tools, such as paper-andpencil tests. In 2008, we carried out a project subsidised by the Institute of Education Sciences at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC), the main aim of which was to elaborate a number of Moodle question pools and to design, implement and assess a series of quizzes from these pools. The project covered the compulsory undergraduate subjects in applied mathematics included in the first- and second-year syllabuses for all branches of Engineering. From the students' results, it was then necessary to examine and revise the reliability of the quizzes as an assessment tool of the teaching and learning process. The analysis of the psychometric coefficients provided by Moodle proved to be a useful tool for assessing whether the questions had an appropriate level of difficulty and were suitable for discriminating between good and bad performers. Taking into account the psychometric analysis of this first project, in 2009 we initiated a new project, in which we planned to revise thoroughly the quizzes created in the former project, to improve their suitability as an assessment tool. This paper shows: i) the students' results in the quizzes performed in the two academic years in the courses Mathematics 1 and Mathematics 2 - both taught in the first year of the four bachelor's degree programmes in Biological Systems Engineering organised by the School of Agricultural Engineering of Barcelona at the UPC, as well as the students' attitudes towards activities of this kind; and ii) the revision and fine-tuning of the quizzes from the psychometric analysis to improve their reliability. Finally, the analysis of the results reported leads to a discussion on the advisability of using this tool for the formative assessment of students.

In this article the e-learning platforms applied in higher education are being looked at. The comparative analysis of certain platforms in respect of their use in a teaching process was made. The analysis was created based on criteria, chosen for the easiest management of the groups of students, easier communication between lecturers and student, as well as for the easy forming of archives and transforming prepared materials in the SCORM/AICC standards. The aim of the article is to facilitate the school management's choice of right systems. This is depending on the needs, as well as pointing out the possibilities of the e-learning platforms. The marking scale presented in the comparison of the platforms clearly confirms that the best platforms are ZSZN. Three systems: BlackBoard, Moodle and ILIAS, are ranked after ZSZN. Depending on the range of the distance learning systems used, the selection among these three platforms depends on the financial capability of a given higher education institution. BlackBoard is a system that provides an exhaustive offer in both asynchronous and synchronous e-learning. ILIAS and Moodle are open systems that support many plug-ins relating to functions that we may need. The paper offers a comparison of the functionality of the most popular e-learning systems. The comparative analysis also looks at the ZSZN system that has been designed mainly with universities of technology in mind. On the basis of the comparative analysis results, the university management will be able to choose an optimum e-learning system that is best adapted to cater to both their needs and financial capabilities. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The project "Languages and Education: constructing and sharing professional knowledge" (PTDC/CED/68813/2006 | FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-007106) evolved around the development of a com-munity-based environment organised in thematic working groups of teachers, educators and research-ers. The research purpose was to study the construction of such community, as well as the professional development trajectories of its members. The community's dynamics were mainly based on face-to-face communication through regular meet-ings. Notwithstanding, the Moodle platform, particularly the discussion forums were used to bridge the gap in-between meetings. This study analyses the interactions (discussion forums and chat) and the documents shared in the Moodle platform of one thematic working group, in order to identify signs of emergence/construction of the aspired professional learning community. This investigation seeks to contribute to knowledge generation about professional learning communities in language education, and puts forward possible routes to follow-up networks or partnerships which may enhance and nurture the culture of collaboration initiated within the project.

With the growth of the world-wide web and e-learning some programs are now fully online but blended learning has also become popular, offering various combinations of internal classes and online content. This paper reports the results of delivering an introductory first-year property course using both online and blended learning. The paper investigates the effectiveness of blended and online learning based on the thesis that blended learning is more effective as students have the advantages of both face-to-face learning and the online environment. A case study approach was adopted that involved two recent cohorts of students. Course statistics from the newly introduced Moodle software were used to analyse how these two groups of students used the online material and how these activities were correlated with their learning outcomes. This paper contributes to higher education pedagogy in online learning by providing insights into the use of a project-based learning approach in engaging students. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Practical examinations in anatomy are usually conducted on specimens in the anatomy laboratory (referred to here as the "traditional" method). Recently, we have started to administer similar examinations online using the quiz facility in Moodle™. In this study, we compare student scores between two assessment environments viz. online and traditional environments. We hypothesized that regardless of the examination medium (traditional or online) overall student performance would not be significantly different. For the online medium, radiological images, prosected specimens, and short video clips demonstrating muscle action were first acquired from resources used for teaching during anatomy practical classes. These were optimized for online viewing and then uploaded onto Moodle learning management software. With regards to the traditional format, actual specimens were usually laid out in a circular stream. Identification tags were then attached to specific spots on the specimens and questions asked regarding those identified spots. A cohort of students taking practical examinations in six courses was studied. The courses were divided into three pairs with each pair credit-weight matched. Each pair consisted of a course where the practical examination was conducted online and the other in the traditional format. There was no significant difference in the mean scores within each course pair. In addition, a significant positive correlation between score in traditional and online formats was found. We conclude that mean grades in anatomy practical examination conducted either online or in the traditional format were comparable. These findings should reassure teachers intending to use either format for their practical examinations. © 2011 American Association of Anatomists.

Project-based learning is one of the main successful student-centered pedagogies broadly used in computing science courses. However, this approach can be insufficient when dealing with practical subjects that implicitly require many deliverables and a great deal of feedback and organizational resources. In this paper, a worked e-portfolio is presented as an approach to improve the teaching/learning and evaluation processes in project-based learning environments needing considerable resources. To validate this approach, a practical project-based software engineering course supported by a Moodle-based e-portfolio was designed and taught. The results obtained corroborated the effectiveness of the e-portfolio in practical software engineering teaching; this approach can be extended to similar subjects in other studies and/or curricula. © 2012 IEEE.

The aim of the study was to compare the method of distance education (b-learning) with the traditional method of teaching of the subject "Obstetrics, gynecology and gynecological and obstetric nursing" held at the Medical University of Bialystok. The study was conducted among 220 third-year students of bachelor level in three academic years 2009-2012. The research group (115 people) participated in e-learning course, while other 105 students participated in a traditional manner. For distance education an LMS/LCMS-Moodle class system was implemented. The effectiveness of both forms of training was compared (including assessment of control tests, assessment of practical exercises and the final exams results). After completing a series of lectures anonymous survey was carried out in both groups. The questionnaire included questions about the organization of classes, learning effectiveness, student satisfaction with the activities carried out and the interest of students in distance learning. Mean ratings of practical classes held after the series of lectures were almost the same in both groups (4.59 in the e-learning group and 4.56 in traditional group). The average final exam grades were 3.55±0.50 in the group of distance learning and 3.49±0.54 in the conventional group. 93% students of the e-learning group and 83% students of conventional group positively rated the organization of classes. A high percentage (98%) of positive feedback about the classes conducted distantly and in traditional manner (86%) suggests a high level of technical content and preparation of both of these forms of activity. Based on the survey it can be concluded that both forms of education are equally effective. Copyright © 2012 Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric.

During the last years, there has been much concern about learning management systems' (LMS) effectiveness when compared to traditional learning and about how to assess students' participation during the course. The tracking and monitoring capabilities of most recent LMS have made it possible to analyse every interaction in the system. The issues addressed on this study are: a Is LMS student's interaction an indicator of academic performance? b Are different results in performance expected between distance and in-class LMS-supported education? c How can LMS interactions from logs be categorised? d May this categorisation detect 'learning witnesses'? To answer these questions, a set of interaction types from Moodle LMS activity record logs has been analysed during two years in online and in-class Master's degrees at the UPM. The results show partial or no evidence of influence between interaction indicators and academic performance, although the proposed categorisation may help detect learning witnesses.

The relationship between technology and education and how both concepts evolve together is now ever more important. It is essential to find new ways to satisfy the necessities of the two main authors of learning platforms,the students and the teachers. Technologies will provide support to those new ways. Consequently, the possibility to interconnect the LMS with other external applications to enrich and strengthen the comprehension of learning process is one of the principal paths to follow.

Course Management Systems (CMS) are an increasingly important part of academic systems in higher education. When choosing a Course Management System for an educational institution, the usability of the system is the key to the effectiveness and efficiency of the online courses that are to be implemented. The goal of this paper is to report the results of a comparative usability study conducted in 2008-2009 on two different course management systems: BlackBoard and Moodle. 135 students enrolled in the Fall 2008 and Spring 2009 sections of Introduction to Educational Technology participated in the study (72 and 63 respectively). At the beginning of each semester, participants were randomly divided into two groups to experience different CMSs at different times. It can be concluded from this study that in almost every module or function comparison that was made, Moodle was favored by course participants over Blackboard with the exception of the Discussion Board module where scores were not significantly different. At the end of the study, the researchers concluded that use of Moodle in online courses can be a suitable alternative to the current CMS system (BlackBoard). In fact, now that the pilot has showed that Moodle is as effective as BlackBoard, the researchers have already shared their experiences with other faculty members and expanded their investigations by involving numerous other online courses, instructors, and students, because the product showed significant potential for further examination. This study adds to the growing body of studies that are carried out to see if an open source CMS (Moodle) warrants consideration as an alternative to the institution's current course management system. In addition to comparing the students' feedback quantitatively, this study also tried to explain in detail what specific component / function of each CMS students found useful or better than in the other. Rather than focusing only on student satisfaction scores, this study further investigated what aspect of each module for each CMS course participants particularly liked or disliked.

Purpose: Develop a trans-disciplinary repository of genomics education resources using a Web-based learning management system. The repository maps and organizes genetic-genomic information and materials relevant to educators by healthcare discipline-specific competencies and performance indicators. Methods: An interdisciplinary project team was established to guide toolkit repository building and usability testing. The toolkit was built using the X-CREDIT software on the Moodle learning management platform, which includes a mapping matrix and browsing function that captures teaching resources in a searchable database linked to competencies, knowledge areas, performance indicators, learning activities and resources, and outcome assessments. Discipline-specific advisory groups assisted in resource identification, competency mapping, and peer review. The toolkit is multidisciplinary, currently including physician assistants and nurses, and provides a resource crosslink to discipline-specific competencies. All resources have a detailed description, and users may contribute new resources, which are peer reviewed for relevance and accuracy by an editorial board. Alpha and beta testing using online usability surveys that included toolkit exercises helped refine the structure, look, and navigation of the final website. Findings: One hundred thirty faculty-124 nursing and 6 physician assistant faculty-agreed to participate. Of those, 59 users (45.4% response rate) completed the online usability survey. Nearly all users (94.9%) were able to find a competency that was relevant to their topic, and 85.4% were able to locate the relevant performance indicators. The majority (86.5%) felt the model adequately described the relationships between competencies, performance indicators, learning activities-resources, and assessments, and made conceptual sense. Survey respondents reported font color and size made the information difficult to read, windows were not large enough, and the "shopping cart" concept was confusing; all of these areas have been modified for the final toolkit version. Conclusions: Alpha and beta testing of the toolkit revealed that users can successfully obtain educational materials by searching competencies and performance indicators. The platform is accessible on the Internet at and can be continually updated as new resources become available. Clinical Relevance: Faculty members need easy access to a wide range of accurate, current resources to facilitate integration of genomics into the curriculum. © 2011 Sigma Theta Tau International.

According to the Bologna Accord in 2006 the study courses for architecture, urban planning and landscape planning at Kassel university were reformed to a bachelor and master education programme. New courses - so called "modules" were found. One of them "Wahrnehmung und Analyse von Räumen" - "landscape perception and analysis" - is an interdisciplinary course teaching and comparing three different perspectives - those of ecology, social science and landscape planning - on landscape. To manage a high number of students the e-learning platform "Moodle" is used. Also giving an introduction into GIS is a major part of the course. This article - after "landscape perception and analysis" started four years ago - gives an overview of the recent and future development of the course from a teachers perspective.

Environmental Education fosters skills and habits that students can utilize throughout their lives to understand and act on environmental issues. The key aspect of this paper shall be focused on the measuring of effective environmental education through "blended learning" among students at the Faculty of Organizational Science, University of Belgrade. In this paper, the activities of students are compared over two academic years; the first without "blended learning" and the second with a "blended learning" platform. A closed form questionnaire for measuring individual ecological footprints has been used in this study to determine the students' environmental behaviour modification (through corresponding environmental actions). An analysis of the results has been carried out using the SPSS software package and the results have indicated that a statistically significant increase of environmental awareness had indeed occurred.

Online learning in higher education has, until most recently, been delivered primarily through learning management systems (LMS) such as BlackBoard, Moodle, and others. However, responding to budgetary concerns and burgeoning enrollments, delivery of online learning via multiple open source (free) formats, is quickly becoming an attractive and inexpensive option for online distance and learning programs. Multiuser virtual environments, or MUVEs, are one such option that provides an interactive and socially rich learning experience for learners. In this chapter, the authors propose a dually fused pedagogical framework that has the potential to provide both asynchronous and synchronous online learning activities the elicit critical thinking skills and that further align with additional skills twenty-first century learners and instructors need to compete in today's global society.

We describe and analyse the action research process carried out by us as teachers in a general didactics course in the University of Malaga (Spain). The course methodology combined lectures to the whole class and small-group work. We were in charge of guiding small-group work. In the small groups, students researched on an educational innovation guided by a teacher from the educative system (primary, secondary, 'A'-level). Students used theoretical concepts explained in lectures to analyse educational innovative realities. Students met with the lecturers at Faculty periodically. These lecturers used online tools to guide small group work between meetings. Specifically, students developed a diary using the ad hoc tool in Online Campus, based on Moodle. Lecturers read the diaries on a regular basis and offered feedback to the students. Additionally, students and lecturers kept in contact between meetings by email and forums. Finally, students submitted a report of their research and lecturers offered feedback before a final version of the report. We carried out an action research process to explore the fit between the general purposes of the course and our work as lecturers with the small groups of students. Moreover, we studied the interrelationship between the meetings at Faculty and the online communication via diaries, email and forums. © 2011 Copyright Educational Action Research.

SUMMARY: New technologies of information and communication are changing society and strongly influence education, creating new scenarios valuable to the teaching and learning. These virtual teaching and learning (VLEs) are software platforms thought to facilitate pedagogical communication among participants in a context of educational process. The aim was to present results of adhesion, performance and educational value of the VLE, specifying underlying population concerns and educational psychology, when applied in neuroanatomy. We designed a VLE using Moodle ® with consultation activities, homework, learning forums, wiki, hypertext and questionnaire. Implemented in 3 committees that submitted 2010 for 1 (obligatory) and 2 (not obligatory) and parameters were evaluated to know the effectiveness of the resource implemented as complementary educational curricula for practical work. The results were evaluated using descriptive statistical tools. 75% of students used the VLE, the frequency of increased access was at night (20-24 hours). We detected difficulties in the daily use of this tool despite its easy access. Half entered 2 times per week, without prevalence of that day, mostly one time per day from home and logged into the site, remaining between 30 and 70 minutes (60%). We determined the correlation between unsatisfactory midterm exam performance and lower resource use (R2> 0.78). We objectified benefit in the use of VLEs in the Neuroanatomy rotation. That resource generated the construction of teaching and learning by reworking the content mediated by the student subjective cognitive structure.

This work presents a system for on-line study purposes and for demonstrative operation of water quality monitoring based on previous full-scale trials in a commercial aquaculture facility under the scope of a R&D project. This system is still under development, and was designed for sharing resources in R&D activities and later in distance learning blended courses. An application developed in Lab-VIEW is responsible for receiving information from physical and chemical data (water level, flow, oxygen, temperature, pH, ORP and CO2) through a hardware interface. The acquired data are recorded in a Microsoft Access database that can be locally queried as desired. An IP camera allows students to observe the system in real-time. Students can log into the system and follow the real-time variations of a specific water quality parameter and the synergetic effects of these changes on the levels of other constituents. The water tanks contain no living beings in order to allow free adjustments of the parameters under study. The system description, data and remote access link is integrated in a basic course available in a Moodle® server. The goal of this course is to provide a stimulating interdisciplinary environment to a diverse group of undergraduate students, where critical research questions related to water are addressed. This system, unique in the area concerning with our knowledge, intends to contribute also to students' training on data monitoring and analysis; and to nourish analytical skills and creativity of future scientists by encouraging potential graduate students to go further. Finally, this system allows the students to be familiar with the use of some new information technologies.

Two important challenges that teachers are currently facing are the sharing and the collaborative authoring of their learning design solutions, such as didactical units and learning materials. On the one hand, there are tools that can be used for the creation of design solutions and only some of them facilitate the co-edition. However, they do not incorporate mechanisms that support the sharing of the designs between teachers. On the other hand, there are tools that serve as repositories of educational resources but they do not enable the authoring of the designs. In this paper we present LdShake, a web tool whose novelty is focused on the combined support for the social sharing and co-edition of learning design solutions within communities of teachers. Teachers can create and share learning designs with other teachers using different access rights so that they can read, comment or co-edit the designs. Therefore, each design solution is associated to a group of teachers able to work on its definition, and another group that can only see the design. The tool is generic in that it allows the creation of designs based on any pedagogical approach. However, it can be particularized in instances providing pre-formatted designs structured according to a specific didactic method (such as Problem-Based Learning, PBL). A particularized LdShake instance has been used in the context of Human Biology studies where teams of teachers are required to work together in the design of PBL solutions. A controlled user study, that compares the use of a generic LdShake and a Moodle system, configured to enable the creation and sharing of designs, has been also carried out. The combined results of the real and controlled studies show that the social structure, and the commenting, co-edition and publishing features of LdShake provide a useful, effective and usable approach for facilitating teachers' teamwork. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This article looks at a year-long network-based exchange between two groups of student-teachers in Spain and the USA, who were involved in various network-based collaborative activities as part of their teaching education. Their online interaction was facilitated through diverse communicative modes such as Skype, Moodle, Voicethread and Second Life (SL). It was found that the participants' interaction with their distanced partners varied according to the available communication modes as they constructed 'membership' identities in the virtual interaction. The analysis hints at the need to reconsider what 'intercultural' means within a 'third space'. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The rapid advances in information and communication technologies allow academic institutions to offer courses via the net. This study looked at the behavior of distance learners in an online course in Natural Sciences, and identified potential considerations in developing and implementing web-based biodiversity education. The study employed log file analysis (LFA) as a method of inquiry, where a total of 6,107 logged data in modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (MOODLE) learning management system were mined and analyzed to discover connectivity patterns of the students. A total of 23 students participated in the study. Three pattern analysis parameters were pre-determined, and used as filters, namely: (a) number of visits (nov), which measures the number of times that a student visited the course site within the semester; (b) time of visits (tov), which indicates the specific time of the day when the student logged on to the course site; and (c) length of visits (lov), which measures the number of hours that a specific student stays in the course site, and is computed as the difference between the log on time and log out time. Three socio-economic factors (i.e. age, work status and internet connection status) were used as explanatory variables for the observed access patterns. Results showed that an online learner visits 265 times in a semester, and is spending an estimated 19.56 hours in the course site. Learners are more active during the night (mean tov night = 3,366) than during the day (mean to vday = 2,895), and spent more time at night (mean lov night = 5.78 hrs) than on day (mean lo vday = 4.46 hrs). Working learners are understandably less active (mean nov = 220) than non-working (mean nov = 325), and mostly active during the night (mean nov night = 109) than on day (mean novday = 81). Though age did not affect the choice of the time of visit, learners' internet connectivity (either at home or elsewhere) showed significant influence (p &lt; 0.05). These patterns can help online educators evaluate and assess learners' learning process, track learners' actions and develop support system to address learning divides in an online biodiversity education. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd.

The development of tele-operated experimentation and its provision to distance learners opens new dimensions for experience-based scientific and engineering education, particularly where experiments are the core elements of teaching and learning. The finalized EU-funded project PeTEX-Platform for e-Learning and Telemetric Experimentation has developed a prototype of an e-learning platform based on the learning and content management system Moodle for the design and implementation of educational and training applications in the field of production engineering. The principle goal of this project was to establish individual and group oriented learning for different target groups like students and professional workers within a platform-system capable to serve a multi-lingual learning community. Hence, an educational model was designed which integrates the tele-operated experimentation platform with teaching content and learning activities in order to support a successful learning walkthrough for different target groups.

Moodle is an extended learning management system for developing learning units, including mathematically-based subjects. A wide variety of material can be developed in Moodle which contains facilities for forums, questionnaires, lessons, tasks, wikis, glossaries and chats. Therefore, the Moodle platform provides a meeting point for those working in a mathematics course. Mathematics requires special materials and activities: The material must include mathematical objects and the activities included in the virtual course must be able to do mathematical computations. WIRIS is a powerful software for educational environments. It has libraries for calculus, algebra, geometry and much more. In this article, examples showing the use of WIRIS in numerical methods and examples of using a new tool, WIRIS quizzes, are illustrated. By enhancing Moodle with WIRIS, we can add random learning questions to modules. Moodle has a simpler version of this capability, but WIRIS extends the method in which the random material is presented to the students. Random objects can appear in a question, in a variable of a question, in a plot or in the definition of a mathematical object. This article illustrates material prepared for numerical methods using a WIRIS library integrated in WIRIS quizzes. As a result, WIRIS in Moodle can be considered as a global solution for mathematics education. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Background The development of scientific knowledge and technology in the field of health sciences evolves so rapidly that the implementation of new ways of continuous education is essential to prevent human resource obsolescence, a circumstance that occurs more frequently than that of other resources of the area. The main activity of the Argentine Society of Cardiology is spreading the scientific knowledge by developing Congresses, publishing the Revista Argentina de Cardiología, organizing face-to-face courses, scientific meetings and the PROSAC, the Argentine Society of Cardiology Distance Learning Program. Objective To communicate the experience of the Cardiology Update Program, PROSAC, implemented by the Argentine Society of Cardiology since 2007. Material and Methods The PROSAC includes texts (printed material), conferences and controversies, case reports, image gallery (included in a CD provided with the printed material) and written tests at the end of each module. All the material is also available at the web site www.sac.org.ar Results The program started in August 2007 and 498 participants were matriculated; by December 2010 the number increased to 847 professionals, 68% men and 32% women; age ranged from 40 to 60 years. The course was published in 5 modules (10 fascicles). The test was taken and approved by 79% of those enrolled in the program. Conclusions This evaluation of the Program considered that the fulfillment of the activities and the level of retaining knowledge were very promising. The Program has been installed in a MOODLE platform since December 2010 in order to achieve more active participation and cooperative learning.

New ICT technologies are continuously introducing changes in the way in which society generates, shares and access information. This is changing what society expects and requires of education. eLearning is acting as a vector of this change, introducing pervasive transformations in and out of the classroom. But with Learning Management Systems (LMS) users have reached a plateau of productivity and stability. At the same time outside the walled garden of the LMS new transformative tools, services and ways of learning are already in use, within the PLE and PLN paradigms. The stability and maturity of the LMS may become yet another resistance factor working against the introduction of innovations. New tools and trends cannot be ignored, and this is the reason why learning platforms should become open and flexible environments. In the course of this article the reasons for this change and how it may be addressed will be discussed, together with a proposal for architecture based on Moodle. © J.UCS.

Objectives: Traditionally, summative practical examination in anatomy takes the form of 'spotters' consisting of a stream of prosections, radiological images and dissections with pins indicating specific structures. Recently, we have started to administer similar examinations online using the quiz facility in Moodle ™(a free, open-source web application for producing modular internet-based courses) in addition to the traditional format. This paper reports on an investigation into students' perceptions of each assessment environment. Methods: Over a 3-year period, practical assessment in anatomy was conducted either in traditional format or online via learning management software called Moodle™. All students exposed to the two examination formats at the College of Medicine & Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Oman, were divided into two categories: junior (Year 3) and senior (Year 4). An evaluation of their perception of both examination formats was conducted using a selfadministered questionnaire consisting of restricted and free response items. Results: More than half of all students expressed a clear preference for the online environment and believed it was more exam-friendly. This preference was higher amongst senior students. Compared to females, male students preferred the online environment. Senior students were less likely to study on cadavers when the examination was conducted online. Specimen quality, ability to manage time, and seating arrangements were major advantages identified by students who preferred the online format. Conclusion: Computer-based practical examinations in anatomy appeared to be generally popular with our students. The students adopted a different approach to study when the exam was conducted online as compared to the traditional 'steeplechase' format.

Recent research indicated that students' ability to construct evidence-based explanations in classrooms through scientific inquiry is critical to successful science education. Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no research work in the literature addressed the issue of automatically assessing the student's argumentation quality, and the teaching load of the teacher that used the online argumentation support environments is not alleviated. In this work, an intelligent argumentation assessment system based on machine learning techniques for computer supported cooperative learning is proposed. Learners' arguments on discussion board were examined by using argumentation element sequence to detect whether the learners address the expected discussion issues and to determine the argumentation skill level achieved by the learner. Learners are first assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their responses to the learning styles questionnaire given right before the beginning of learning activities on the e-learning platform. A feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to the learners in case the argumentation assessment system detects that the learners go in a biased direction. The Moodle, an open source software e-learning platform, was used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed work is effective in classifying and improving student's argumentation level and assisting the students in learning the core concepts taught at a natural science course on the elementary school level. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last decade, Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), a form of narrative often involving multiple media and gaming elements to tell a story that might be affected by participants' actions, have been used in the marketing and promotion of a number of entertainment related products such as films, computer games and music. This paper discusses the design, development and evaluation of an ARG aimed at increasing the motivations of secondary school level students across Europe in the learning of modern foreign languages. The ARG was developed and implemented as part of a European Commission Comenius project and involved 6 project partners, 328 secondary school students and 95 language teachers from 17 European countries. The collaborative nature of ARGs provides a potentially useful vehicle for developing collaborative activities within an educational context. This paper describes the educational value of ARGs, in particular the ARG for supporting the teaching of modern European languages and the specific activities that were developed around Web 2.0 and gaming that underpinned the ARG and helped promote cooperation and learning within an educational environment. An evaluation of the ARG was conducted using an experimental design of pre-test → ARG intervention → post-test. 105 students completed the pre-test, 92 students completed the post-test and 45 students completed both the pre-test and post-test questionnaires. In general, student attitudes towards the ARG were very positive with evidence suggesting that the ARG managed to deliver the motivational experience expected by the students. The majority of students who completed the post-test either agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to play the game over a prolonged period of time as part of a foreign language course. In addition, through using the ARG, students believed that they obtained skills relating to cooperation, collaboration and teamwork. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this article I will argue that the use of learning content management systems is also justified in full-time education, especially in business education and communication studies. Nowadays not only multinational companies, but domestic medium enterprises also manage the training of new employees and existing staff with LCMSs. Companies in Hungary's financial sector are cutting edge in the development of electronic learning objects, and base employees' training on these new technologies. That is why it is extremely important for students to get acquainted with learning management systems and other web-based applications as tools that support the learning process and also as sites of communication. I will present the business communication Moodle course, which was introduced to international business and commerce and marketing studies in the 2010/2011 academic year. I want to present the wide range of web2.0 applications that can be used to explore the fields of business communication. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

The existing open-source object-oriented systems that can be used as an environment to upload and to store information-educational resources for distance learning (open-source LMS\LCMS: ATutor, Claroline, Dokeos, Sakai, and Moodle), are analyzed. The use of Moodle (a Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) as the environment for the learning portal of the Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology of Russia (http://moodle.muctr.ru) is justified. The capabilities of Moodle with regard to the development of information-educational resources are explored and educational materials are elaborated for a course of study, viz., "Protection of Intellectual Property," e. g., theoretical materials, seminar and colloquia exercises, tests for interim and final control of student's knowledge level, as well as the elements of a learning process management system for a course of study. © 2011 Allerton Press, Inc.

This paper presents the rationale behind the utilization of a Moodle Learning Management System for the facilitation of a blended learning approach in the Informatics department. The authors present and analyze the steps followed in order to replace the prior decentralized organizational structure of the courses, which consisted of a multitude of different and incompatible systems. The main goal was to implement a single system, which would be easy to operate, maintain, and update, and would cater to the variety of instructor and student needs. Furthermore, evaluation data of the new system is presented in detail. The analysis of the results serves to confirm the success of this department-wide migration. Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

It is the task of the economists to assess - under the conditions of the public budgets restrictions - whether the return rate of investments into public projects is sufficient enough in order to justify these projects in comparison to an alternative utilization of the expended resources. Complex e-learning systems, which include both the educational part and the subsequent verification of the students' knowledge, have lately been gaining on popularity in agriculture, in the public IC T projects from the field of education. The objective of the article is to explain the means of expressing economic efficiency of public projects on the example of establishing the Moodle e-learning system.

Many articles discuss the contributions of Moodle, but a focus on energy education and student perspectives in higher education are very limited. This study implemented an undergraduate energy education course in Moodle as an extension of a face-to-face course. 30 Taiwanese higher education students in the fourth grade were divided into six groups of five adopted STAD. To observe chat room and discussion forum messages in the course of 18 weeks, students filled out an online survey for webbased cooperative learning perspectives and were asked without pressure under semester scores on their experiences using an e-learning platform. Qualitative findings indicate student learning outcomes on energy technology plus success through cooperation via the Moodle e-learning platform.

Background: The Spanish Palliative Care Strategy recommends an intermediate level of training for primary care physicians in order to provide them with knowledge and skills. Most of the training involves face-to-face courses but increasing pressures on physicians have resulted in fewer opportunities for provision of and attendance to this type of training. The effectiveness of on-line continuing medical education in terms of its impact on clinical practice has been scarcely studied. Its effect in relation to palliative care for primary care physicians is currently unknown, in terms of improvement in patient's quality of life and main caregiver's satisfaction. There is uncertainty too in terms of any potential benefits of asynchronous communication and interaction among on-line education participants, as well as of the effect of the learning process. The authors have developed an on-line educational model for palliative care which has been applied to primary care physicians in order to measure its effectiveness regarding knowledge, attitude towards palliative care, and physician's satisfaction in comparison with a control group. The effectiveness evaluation at 18 months and the impact on the quality of life of patients managed by the physicians, and the main caregiver's satisfaction will be addressed in a different paper. Methods: Randomized controlled educational trial to compared, on a first stage, the knowledge and attitude of primary care physicians regarding palliative care for advanced cancer patients, as well as satisfaction in those who followed an on-line palliative care training program with tutorship, using a Moodle Platform vs. traditional education. Results: 169 physicians were included, 85 in the intervention group and 84 in the control group, of which five were excluded. Finally 82 participants per group were analyzed. There were significant differences in favor of the intervention group, in terms of knowledge (mean 4.6; CI 95%: 2.8 to 6.5 (p = 0.0001), scale range 0-33), confidence in symptom management (p = 0.02) and confidence in terms of communication (p = 0.038). Useful aspects were pointed out, as well as others to be improved in future applications. The satisfaction of the intervention group was high. Conclusions: The results of this study show that there was a significant increase of knowledge of 14%-20% and a significant increase in the perception of confidence in symptom management and communication in the intervention group in comparison with the control group that received traditional methods of education in palliative care or no educational activity at all. The overall satisfaction with the intervention was good-very good for most participants. This on-line educational model seems a useful tool for palliative care training in primary care physicians who have a high opinion about the integration of palliative care within primary care. The results of this study support the suggestion that learning effectiveness should be currently investigated comparing different Internet interventions, instead of Internet vs. no intervention. © 2011 Pelayo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Objective: To validate the proposal for development of a virtual collaborative environment for training of nuclear medicine personnel. Materials and Methods: Organizational assumptions, constraints and functionalities that should be offered to the professionals in this field were raised early in the development of the environment. The prototype was developed in the Moodle environment, including data storage and interaction functionalities. A pilot interaction study was developed with a sample of specialists in nuclear medicine. Users' opinions collected by means of semi-structured questionnaire were submitted to quantitative and content analysis. Results: The proposal of a collaborative environment was validated by a community of nuclear medicine professionals and considered as an aid in the training in this field. Suggestions for improvements and new functionalities were made. There is a need to establish a program for education of moderators specifically for this environment, considering the different interaction characteristics as the online and conventional teaching methods are compared. Conclusion: The collaborative environment will allow the exchange of experiences and case discussions among professionals from institutions located in different regions all over the country, enhancing the collaboration among them. Thus, the environment can contribute in the early and continued education of nuclear medicine professionals. © Colégio Brasileiro de Radiologia e Diagnóstico por Imagem.

In this paper, an educational methodology based on collaborative and competitive learning is proposed. The suggested approach has been successfully applied to an undergraduate communication networks course, which is part of the core curriculum of the three-year degree in telecommunications engineering at the University of Valladolid in Spain. This methodology is supported by two tools: the Moodle wiki for the collaborative part and a competitive learning tool called QUESTOURnament, which has been created by the authors to encourage the development of students' inquiry, documentation, and critical analysis skills while raising the level of involvement and communication between students and teachers. This paper describes how the collaborative and competitive approaches were combined and how the activities were ordered in phases. This educational proposal has been validated with academic outcomes and students' feedback. © 2011 IEEE.

A combination of social network analysis and content analysis was used to investigate the interactions that took place in an online Moodle course among 22 participants that were enrolled in a teacher education graduate program. The purpose of this study was to examine both the patterns and quality of the online interactions, which were assessed using a content analysis schema. The social network measures of the online learning network demonstrated that Moodle may have the capability to help establish a cohesive online learning community where members are able to participate in meaningful social interactions. Results from the coding of discussion posts demonstrated that, despite active online interactions, participants still lacked higher level knowledge co-construction. Factors that might impede online knowledge construction processes are examined and discussed so that higher levels of knowledge construction can be encouraged and eventually realized.

Advancements in web technologies and the increased influence of the World Wide Web are leading to new and innovative ways of learning. New e-learning system technologies and services enable activities that allow users to be active learners, actively participating in the on-line learning process. When an elearning system with new technologies and services is presented, it needs to be adopted by its users. The acceptance and use of an e-learning system can be influenced by different factors. The objective of this research is to examine the factors that have an impact on students' perceptions about the use and acceptance of Moodle - an open source e-learning system. In this study, the technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as an underlying theory. The data, collected from 235 students, was used to test the hypothesized research model. A data analysis was performed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results of the analysis have revealed that the actual use of Moodle depends on two main factors: Behavioural intentions and attitudes toward using Moodle. Perceived usefulness was found as the strongest and the most important predictor of attitudes toward using Moodle. Several practical and theoretical implications of the present study are discussed at the end of the paper.

Data analysis (given as mean±sem) showed that students (n = 642) rated (Likert scale, 1-6) the importance of gender-specific medicine fairly high (4.02±0.06), and rated the importance of knowing about gender-specific medicine as a medical doctor even higher (4.49±0.05). Further implementation of gender-relevant topics into the curriculum appeared less important (3.64±0.06). Students rated their own knowledge on gender-specific medicine neutrally (3.40±0.05). For some items significant differences between males and females as well as the old and new curriculum were found. Students considered gender-specific medicine as important but sufficiently covered in their medical education at the MUV. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

This research consists of an empirical study of online persistence in Web-supported courses in higher education, using Data Mining techniques. Log files of 58 Moodle websites accompanying Tel Aviv University courses were drawn, recording the activity of 1189 students in 1897 course enrollments during the academic year 2008/9, and were analyzed with statistical procedures and the Decision Tree algorithm. This yielded five groups of students whose behavior throughout the semester was described: Low-extent Users, Late Users, Online Quitters, Accelerating Users, and Decelerating Users. Results suggest that 46% of the students either decelerated their online activity or totally quit on the other hand, 42% either accelerated their activity or utilized the course website only towards the end of the semester. Additional state-or-trait analysis showed that type of persistence of online activity might be explained by both personal and course characteristics. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Generally Engineering students need managerial training to be coupled with their intensive technical skills which they obtained during their five years engineering program at Islamic University of Gaza (IUG). There is always a legal marriage between academia and industry to reduce the gap between both of the them; therefore this paper presents the importance and the urgent needs for introducing an Engineering Management (EM) course as a technical elective in the curriculum of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at IUG, as it was assessed by both academies and practical engineering managers as part of the joint need assessment efforts, Hussein (2010). This article addresses the link between industry and the management skills that students normally gain. Several interviews were conducted as a research methodology instrument used to validate and give credibility to the main issue of this paper; therefore as a result some valuable comments from current and previous students who graduated as well local industry engineering managers are given, on the other hand current enrolled students fill a standard e-survey to evaluate the course as well. Finally the paper presents the implementation of the state -of- the art e-Learning virtual environment by using open source Moodle as an enhancement tool for the traditional existence course in addition to utilization Face Book to show the effect of the course on improving the case studies and projects.

In most medical schools, summative practical examination in Anatomy usually takes the format of a "steeplechase" ("spotters" or "bell ringers") conducted in the gross anatomy laboratory using cadaveric material and prosected specimens. Recently, we have started to administer similar examinations online using the quiz facility in WebCT™ and Moodle™. This article chronicles how we conceived and developed this method within the peculiar nature of our medical school setting. Over a five year period, practical summative examinations were organized as "steeplechase" online. The online examinations were administered using WebCT™ and later Moodle™ learning management software. Assessment "objects" were created from the materials available for anatomy teaching. These were digital images of cadaveric materials, radiological, and prosected specimens. In addition, short video clips of 30 seconds duration demonstrating muscle action were produced. These objects were optimized for online viewing and then uploaded onto the learning management software. A bank of questions (multiple choice or short answer type) was then created and linked to the assessment objects. These were used in place of the steeplechase in the computer laboratory. This method serves a crucial purpose in places like ours where continuous availability of human cadavers is impossible. Although time consuming initially, once questions are setup online, future retrieval, and administration becomes convenient especially where there are large batches of students. In addition, the online environment offers distinct advantages with regards to image quality, psychometric analysis of the examination and reduction of staff preparation time compared to traditional "steeplechase.

In the last decade, not only the advances in educational investigation but also the reforms promoted in the European Space of Higher Education, have brought about a change in the concept of learning, and in consequence, in the evaluation. However, the evaluation is today a task which is still unfinished in the Spanish university, in which the greater part of the teachers evaluate practically exclusively through a final exam based of memorised questions (Zabalza, 2003; Bonsón and Benito, 2005). This traditional model is more obvious in online teaching. In this study we propose the integration of this new model of evaluation in the e-learning Moodle Platform and we propose the online forum as a communication tool with wide possibilities for didactic innovation and for the assessment from an alternative approach. We also offer a proposal to assess the online forum via an instrument like the rubric. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Learning Management Systems are among the most popular e-learning tools. Over the last few years, however, scientific research has made considerable progress in developing valuable resources currently unavailable in most Learning Management Systems, including solutions aimed at providing students with personalized support throughout the learning process, which is an essential requirement in continuing education. Observing and modeling the learner, and adapting their learning experience accordingly means opening up new technological and, above all, methodological perspectives in e-learning. The work described in this paper is part of the Open Learning project, in which business-based and university researchers aim to combine the most frequently used e-learning technologies, Learning Management Systems, with the benefits of customized systems so as to develop an innovative learning content delivery system based on the personalization of the learning experience. The proposed system integrates Moodle with an engine, LS-Plan, which provides automated sequencing of the learning material based on the learner's knowledge and learning styles. This paper describes the new system and presents the results of tests conducted in the domain of Italian Neorealist Cinema.

Recent research shows that the abilities and competencies of the so-called 'digital natives' have often been overrated and that children and young adults often use such technologies only to play or to communicate. In this respect, it is necessary to provide the digital natives with a suitable scaffolding in order to encourage more 'advanced' applications of such technologies, that could also involve the creation of learning networks. This paper describes a case study: the use of a social network as part of a formal course of Management at the University of Pisa. The institutional Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) - based on Moodle - has been integrated with a student support group hosted on Ning. Problems and opportunities for using Ning have been discussed in small groups and students feedback will be reported. The shift from Learning Management System (course-centric) to a Personal Learning Environment (PLE, people-centric) and then to Personal Learning Network (community-based) is also been discussed and a framework was provided for a further implementation of the platform.

Project-based learning (PBL) and cooperative learning are, in various aspects, very superior education methodologies compared to other traditional ones. They are highly appropriate methodologies for elective courses, as they exert a strong attraction on the students, quite apart from their educational advantages. This paper describes how PBL and cooperative learning have been used to teach the topics of power supplies and photovoltaic electricity within two elective undergraduate courses. A project is carried out for each of the two topics. Moodle is used as the e-learning platform to provide the course materials and the wiki resource and to allow the submission of assignments. The simulation is done by means of Simulink. Work has been done to develop skills for project planning, group management of the work, technical document writing and presentations in public. The methodology has been seen to be successful, as all the students who have followed it over the last few years have passed the courses in which it was included, Design of Industrial Applications and Industrial Electronics. Examples of the rubrics for assessing the projects and examples of the projects themselves are also included. © 2010 IEEE.

This study examines the use of Moodle assisted online collaboration environment in a Special Teaching Techniques class. In this paper, the authors investigate the effect of Moodle assisted online collaboration on prospective secondary mathematics teachers’ attitudes toward the use of the Internet and evaluate the prospective teachers’ opinions regarding the process. The method of this study is one grouped pre-test post-test model. The 30 participants of secondary mathematics education without thesis program are the study group of this research. The special mathematics teaching techniques class supported lessons with the help of the Moodle environment for 9 weeks. After the process, no significant difference existed in the attitudes of the prospective mathematics teachers toward Internet usage. However, according to the interviews, the teachers said they found the process advantageous and favorable and want further implementations in other classes. © 2011, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

The paper presents a wiki for creating structured educational content,accessible via a web browser, for defining practical tasks and understanding the measurement instrumentation - which are often necessary in technical universities. It can be used as a complementary aid for open source e-Learning environments like Moodle. The idea is to allow teachers to create and share an instrument knowledge base and to use and reuse information for configuring on-line lessons related to the laboratory work. The knowledge is structured according to an ontology specific to the measurement instrumentation domain, but teachers are also able to extend it with other concepts.

Modern engineering programs have to address rapidly changing technical content and have to enable students to develop transferable skills such as critical evaluation, communication skills and lifelong learning. This paper introduces a combined learning and assessment activity that provides students with opportunities to develop and practice their soft skills, but also extends their theoretical knowledge base. Key tasks included self directed inquiry, oral and written communication as well as peer assessment. To facilitate the SPIDER activities (Select, Prepare and Investigate, Discuss, Evaluate, Reflect), a software tool has been implemented in the learning management system Moodle. Evidence shows increased student engagement and better learning outcomes for both transferable as well as technical skills. The study focuses on generalising the relationship between learning outcomes and assignment tasks as well as activities that drive these tasks. Trail results inform the approach. Staff evaluations and their views of assignments and intended learning outcomes also supported this analysis.

The primary objective of this paper is to unveil the specific problems noticed in the quality of the MCA students emerging out of Anna University affiliated colleges and to suggest a research work which may lead to a collective feasible solution for these problems. MCA students enter the professional PG course in computer applications after their UG degree from different arts and science disciplines with just ancillary level mathematics background. So, the course faces heterogeneous entry behaviour. Also due to the advent of more engineering and arts colleges offering MCA, students exhibit a heterogeneous behaviour in their motivation levels, communication skills, logical and reasoning aptitude and computer software skills. But the requirement is to enable them with good academic performance with scope of employability. Employability skills include communication skills, logical aptitude, programming logic, computer-software-based technical skills and so on. Learning management system (LMS) is a software through which students can access the course, enroll, attend and write formative quiz-type exams to assignments and can participate in forums to share their ideas through online. While participating in a forum or quiz or writing to a blog, students with less confidence are able to overcome their inhibition and communicate freely. This is the first step of growth in communication skills which subsequently help them to gain better technical skills. The current research proposes to design, develop and deliver a part of a computer science courseware for 'Object oriented programming with Java' through the Open source LMS Moodle. The design of courseware includes the lecture session of the course, lecture notes, corresponding formative evaluation questions like quiz and other evaluation methods like forum and assignments. Installing an LMS and making the students attend the classes through that media is a matter of hesitation in many of the Indian Universities. Though Open source LMSs like Moodle and Sakai are available and proved good, initial efforts have to be put up not only by the faculty members for content and formative evaluation tool development but also by the administration. Administration has to support the project financially, in gaining the necessary infrastructure and for the internet connectivity throughout the learning period. But, weighing the benefits and limitations of LMS, we understand that for the better future of the students in the national and international level, in the long run LMS-based education will serve the best. A research project to justify the advantages and disadvantages quantifying the various aspects is planned. This paper also suggests that if at least one of the pre-final semester papers is offered through an open-source LMS, the students, institution and the nation will be benefitted. © Indian Society for Education and Environment (iSee).

As debate ensues over the nation's priority to build 'a gold-standard Internet network' as Communications Minister, Senator Stephen Conroy describes it, his government's broadband initiative, the NBN, has many Australians asking what the business case for a super-fast broadband service might be. With educationalists alert to the fact that the 21st century classroom leaves the closed, teacher-centric, facts-based model of learning behind, the curriculum is being redesigned, teacher practice is changing, and technology tools that cater for an extensible, customised approach to learning are being developed. Amongst the most compelling technology services for consideration are multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs); these are emerging technology platforms which can be hosted on servers or sold as software that enable 3D rendering of real or composed scenarios, events, people and places, which may be shared in real time with multiple other users, stream rich media and which can integrate learning management systems, such as 'moodle'. The aim of this paper is, firstly, to outline the important role MUVEs could play in our virtual classrooms, and, secondly, to assess whether policy and curriculum development are mindful of the advantages of implementing MUVEs, as there is evidence that MUVEs are being overlooked by ICT strategists and in the setting of Australia's first national curriculum. This discursive paper shows where the omissions are, and suggests that, as far as the implementation of 3D virtual environments in the education sector goes, there may be a disconnection between those who 'do' (the teachers) and those who 'plan' (the policy makers).

Nowadays, personalized education is a very hot topic in technology enhanced learning (TEL) research. To support students during their learning process, the first step consists in capturing the context in which they evolve. Users typically operate in a heterogeneous environment when learning, including learning tools such as Learning Management Systems and non-learning tools and services such as e-mails, instant messaging, or web pages. Thus, user attention in a given context defines the Contextualized Attention Metadata (CAM). Various initiatives and projects allow capturing CAMs in a knowledge workers' environment not only in the TEL area, but also in other domains like Knowledge Work Support, Personal Information Management and Information Retrieval. After reviewing main existing approaches according to some specific criteria that are of main interest for capturing and sharing user contexts, we present in this paper a framework able to gather CAMs produced by any tool or computer system. The framework is built on the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) standard dedicated to system, network and application management. Attention information specific to heterogeneous tools are represented as a unified and extensible structure, and stored into a central repository compliant with the above-mentioned standard. To facilitate access to this attention repository, we introduced a middleware layer composed of two dynamic services: the first service allows users to define the attention data they want to collect, whereas the second service is dedicated to receive and retrieve the traces produced by computer systems. An implementation for collecting and storing CAM data generated by the Ariadne Finder and Moodle validates our approach. © J.UCS.

The emerging importance of Second Language (L2) Digital Literacy within English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Korea is becoming apparent. This is likely to evolve to where L2 Digital Literacy becomes regarded as the most critical component of overall L2 English Literacy. Computer-based Internet-hosted Learning Management Systems (LMS) are rapidly being adopted worldwide for distance education, and are also being applied to blended (hybrid) education. LMS such as the popular open-source Moodle have a special potential in EFL Education: by setting the LMS to force English to be used exclusively throughout a course website, the meta-language can be made the target L2 language. Students develop the ability to use English to navigate the Internet, access and contribute to online resources, and engage in computer-mediated communication. Through such necessary and pragmatic engagement with English, students significantly develop their L2 Digital Literacy.

E-learning is a modern teaching method using computing technology. A lot of courses in every field are executed by e-learning. The education of energy science and technology is too. Many researches reveal the achievement that use e-learning to educate on the energy science and technology in Taiwan, but scarcely concentrate on higher education. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss student's thinking of training program by e-learning on introductory course of energy science and technology. The training program consists of eighteen weeks and allows students for self-study. It also can be helpful to traditional courses which take place at the university (in eighteen weeks semester cycle). During the courses, students execute a program based on e-learning. The program tries to make an interactive tool available to students through a website. Moodle is chosen as the Course Management System (CMS) due to its cooperative philosophy, open-source and free development model. Moodle is activated concurrently with presented courses to provide activities and template questions to increase students' profession in relevant subjects. An approach using social software to support e-learning is presented. The new paradigm on introductory course of energy science and technology can be fostered with the help of e-learning technologies, which take students' advantage of familiarity with computers. © Common Ground, Chin-Wen Liao, Tsai-Hsiu Chen.

This study evaluated the multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) known as Second Life, integrated with Moodle and SLOODLE technologies, as an exploratory course delivery platform and for its ability to enable teachers to meet elements of NETS•T. Graduate student participants (N = 17) interacted, constructed simulated schools, and attended classes in the MUVE. The researcher used pre- and posttest measures of self-efficacy and learning efficiency to understand the effects of the MUVE on participants and their rate of learning to make educational use of the environment. Findings imply that the technologies have potential as a distance-learning platform and as a tool to meet elements of NETS•T. Preparing teachers to use the MUVE for these purposes is likely to require a significant amount of scaffolding. ©, Copyright ISTE.

South Australian rural and remote schools have been using a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance curriculum opportunities for students whose teachers are at a different campus or different school, or who are out of the school for extended periods of time undertaking courses, such as, Vocational Education and Training (VET). A case study approach was used to identify the strategies that have been implemented by the teachers and to examine the perceptions of students and teachers about the success of these strategies in supporting the learners in a sustainable manner. Some of the strategies that were used to connect the learners and teachers were: (i) video conferencing and interactive whiteboards (IWB) to conduct classes in real time at a local and remote school, (ii) using Moodle as a means of making class material available when and where the student needed it and (iii) connecting to remote sites to do a virtual visit.

The use of online learning technology to support classroom learning has gradually gained acceptance in the higher education community, augmenting and in some cases supplanting the traditional lecture delivery method. This paper presents a case study which details the experiences of the author in developing what began as a simple Wiki platform into a highly functional classroom management system. The Wiki was developed using open source software acquired in 2002 and then customized and reprogrammed by the author and used in various higher education classroom settings from 2004 to 2009. The Wiki provides a central repository for all class activity and allows both the instructor and the student to add content to the class web site. The web site provides an orderly, streamlined presentation of course content that is appropriate for the course, an approach markedly different from that of a generically structured course management system such as BlackBoard, Sakai, or Moodle. The paper will first provide a historical perspective on the use of Wikis and other collaboration and knowledge aggregation software in the classroom, and then provide detail on the features and functions of the modified Wiki. Finally, analysis of student usage of the Wiki and the results of a student survey about the Wiki web site will be reviewed and discussed. This analysis provides additional insights on the use and effectiveness of the customized Wiki. © Common Ground, Arthur Taylor, All Rights Reserved.

A number of contemporary factors have combined to create a situation that encourages and supports international collaboration among institutions of higher education. Factors such as the globalization of the economy, the increasingly international nature of higher education, and the development of an inexpensive and virtually worldwide system of communication, the Internet, have all played their part. This paper focuses on one aspect of international collaboration-the creation and dissemination of information resources and information/educational technologies, such as software. Movements such as Open Source and Open Access have encouraged colleges and universities to consider alternatives to the dominant model for acquiring everything from college textbooks to academic computing software. Today for-profit companies supply most such resources to institutions, faculty, and students. The open source software approach is an alternative based on collaboration between both institutions and individuals, and it is a viable alternative to commercial, for-profit development and dissemination systems. Today, open access journals, for example, compete with journals from commercial publishers and provide free access to anyone via the Internet. Resources such as the courseware management system, Moodle, and the multipurpose software package, Sakai, are examples of open source software-developed resources that are widely used today in higher education. The OpenCourseware initiative at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an example of free and open dissemination of course resources. Variations of the open source software model support the creation of everything from infrastructure software such as Sakai to remixable textbooks. Remixing is, in fact, a major advantage of the approach Connexions, based at Rice University, has taken to create information resources for educational use. Open access, open source, and other similar approaches can be subsumed under the term open education. That movement is a viable, and rapidly growing, alternative for the creation and distribution of information and information technology resources for higher education that is particularly suited to collaborative, international partnerships. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Increasing environmental concerns and legislation in many states and in other countries require that we take a more comprehensive sustainable ''best management'' approach to production techniques in nursery and greenhouse operations. This is particularly important because these production facilities are typically intense users of resources that are applied to relatively small land areas. We have developed an online knowledge center to facilitate the implementation of more sustainable practices within the nursery and greenhouse industry. A web-based knowledge center provides the most cost-effective mechanism for information delivery, as our potential audiences are extremely diverse and widespread. We currently have a registered user database of over 450 educators, growers, and industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students. A gateway website provides an overview of the issues and the goals of the project. The associated knowledge center currently has 25 in-depth learning modules, designed in a Moodle learning management framework. These learning modules are designed to actively engage learners in topics on substrate, irrigation, surface water, and nutrient and crop health management, which are integral to formulating farm- specific strategies for more sustainable water and nutrient management practices. Additional modules provide assessment and implementation tools for irrigation audits, irrigation methods and technologies, and water and nutrient management planning. The instructional design of the learning modules was paramount because there can be multiple strategies to improve site-specific production practices, which often require an integration of knowledge from engineering, plant science, and plant pathology disciplines. The assessment and review of current practices, and the decision to change a practice, are often not linear, nor simple. All modules were designed with this process in mind, and include numerous resources [pictures, diagrams, case studies, and assessment tools (e.g., spreadsheets and example calculations)] to enable the learner to fully understand all of the options available and to think critically about his/her decisions. Sixteen of the modules were used to teach an intensive 400-level ''Principles of Water and Nutrient Management'' course at the University of Maryland during Spring 2008 and 2009. The water and nutrient management planning module also supports the nursery and greenhouse Farmer Training Certification program in Maryland. The Maryland Department of Agriculture provides continuing education credits for all consultants and growers who register and complete any module in the knowledge center. Although these learning resources were developed by faculty in the eastern region of the United States, much of the information is applicable to more widespread audiences.

We assert in this paper that e-learning platforms have come of age. They are not only well accepted, but they also are (Table presented) affordable, easy to use, and are becoming expected, especially by students who have grown up immersed in the flexibility of digital media - the digital native generation. Financial difficulties and the emergence of new technologies have impelled universities to create new systems for delivering education in science. Technology can enable and facilitate the communication and transmission of information, providing students with the opportunity to exchange knowledge and resources and develop mutual understanding. In a computer cluster the teacher has face-to-face interactions with the students, whereas VLEs such as Blackboard and Moodle support communication components that enable both asynchronous and synchronous information exchange and online discussion. These platforms allow the management of content, students, and teachers and offer a large variety of resources and activities, such as quizzes and workshops. In both cases, the teacher can manage a high number of learners, reduce the laboratory cost, give students time to process any new information by making connections with their previous knowledge, and improve student performance in collaborative situations. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

It is substantially accepted that constructivism proposes knowledge as "not a fixed object"; constructed by an individual through her own experiences. As a learning theory, constructivism in education emphasizes collaborative learning, such as authentic challenging projects involving in students, teachers and experts in the learning community. Its goal is to create learning communities that are more closely related to the collaborative practice of the real world as strongly reflected in social constructivist idea. The technologies used in the filed of education will support learning through collaborative practices, using learners' experiences for "meaning making". The challenge now is to extend the educational networks so that it offers access to learning resources, online storage and tools for communication and management not just within the limitation of school and time. Through learning platforms, such as Moodle, teachers and administrators may bring hardware, software and supporting services together to enable more effective conditions among teachers and students. In this study, Moodle was used to support the 4th grade pre-service language teachers' (student teachers) one of the academic courses, named as "Field Experience". The student teachers were expected to prepare graduation theses in the field of English language teaching. Moodle was integrated as a technological learning aid and used as online support throughout a semester "course. So, we will discuss how Moodle was integrated as a learning platform, while discussing, the use of Moodle as a "course supporter" process, steps and the sample activities will be presented as well.

Online education based on small self-managing groups, with slight supervision by a professional tutor, is a strategically interesting methodology for lifelong learning. This solution may combine aspects of cost-effectiveness (reducing tutors' work) with the demands for active and engaging learning methods based on the exchange and sharing of experiences. In such a context, how can information on collaborative attitudes and behaviour be gathered? A typical tool for online learning activities is the threaded web forum. This study proposes a methodology for assessing effective collaborative interactions within the add-on module, Forum Plus, for the Moodle learning management system (LMS). The methodology here presented is able to supply an early overview of the level of effectiveness of the collaborative group and therefore it may provide a useful instrument to guide further qualitative observations conducted directly in the web forum. © 2009 Becta.

This module goes beyond the mere hosting of resources and assignments. It makes use of an automatic checking and verification engine that works on the VHDL designs submitted by the students. The module automatically keeps up to date information about their state, and significantly reduces the overload that a continuous assessment demands to the teacher. Additionally, this new module is oriented to promote a collaborative teamwork allowing to define student teams in a more operative way than built-in Moodle groups. The module has been designed according to the Moodle philosophy and its application can be extended to other similar subjects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper identifies a set of universal instructional design (UID) principles appropriate to distance education (DE) and tailored to the needs of instructional designers and instructors teaching online. These principles are then used to assess the accessibility level of a sample online course and the availability of options in its LMS platform (Moodle™) to increase course accessibility. Numerous accessibility-sensitive plug-in modules are found to be available to Moodle users, though relatively few features were included in the sample course analysed. This may be because they have not been made available to instructors at the institutional level. The paper offers a series of recommendations to improve the accessibility of online DE to learners with diverse abilities, disabilities, and needs.

Technology and computers have affected teaching and learning English in Thai higher education. The multi-functionality of Learning-Management System (LMS) such as Moodle is integrated in English language classrooms to enhance students' learning. To facilitate the importance of teacher preparation for E-learning use, it is important to study the facts influencing teachers in integrating Moodle into their English classrooms and to explore the opinion from students who learn English by using Moodle. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were employed in this study. The results showed that 6 of 18 teachers from School of English at Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) used Moodle to supplement their English language teaching. Most of them used the uploading and sharing documents feature in order to assign students' homework and encouraged students to download learning material outside the class to practice their English learning skills. It was also found that Moodle facilitates student-centered and anytime-anywhere learning. Moreover, it makes course administration easier and helps to reduce the cost and time of delivering instruction. In addition, 213 students were asked questions on using Moodle, the results showed they had positive opinions toward learning English via Moodle. However, there are some disadvantages of using Moodle in English language teaching as network and technical problems were also discussed in the study. © Common Ground.

This paper examines approaches to innovation as theoretical background to systems development life cycle (SDLC) practices employed during open source software development using MOODLE to implement a new virtual learning environment (VLE) for an e-learning project at the University of East London (UEL). The School of Computing, Information Technology and Engineering (CITE) and UELconnect, UEL's distance learning arm, have worked together to develop and implement the new VLE. The paper argues that the emerging Adaptive Innovation Approach, when used as a broad SDLC framework and inclusive of the respective work done by Eric von Hippel on Distributed Innovation and Henry Chesbrough on Open Innovation, can support a practitioneroriented and a user-centred SDLC to better account for new cultural necessities and new economic realities dominating our dynamic global era. The paper takes a closer look at the development of UEL's MOODLE-based VLE for its adaptive innovation qualities and offers various lessons from the validation of a Fully Online MSc Business Information Technology (BIT) that was developed alongside with the VLE. Finally, the paper offers some additional observations from testing MOODLE's eMail Block installed in the new VLE to accommodate internal communication for the newly validated MSc.

In recognition of the difficulties posed for New Zealand medical students by travel during rural general practice attachments, a system of distance teaching was devised for final year medical students at the Waikato Clinical School. In place of weekly small group teaching using reflection on practice at the central campus led by a tutor, students participated in reflective learning via an electronic web based message board and once weekly brief individual discussion with a tutor. Moodle and Skype, both freeware applications, were used as the methods of facilitating asynchronous and synchronous learning environments. Students experienced significantly less travel time as a result of the innovation. They also reported enthusiasm for the modes of teaching and the technology. A small increase in tutor time commitment was necessary. Distance education initiatives can be undertaken with minimal expense in the general practice setting. The educational opportunities it offers can be similar to, but not identical to small group teaching.

Web resources in Latin American higher education institutions have been reported to show a much stronger emphasis on Information than on Communication. A Course Management System (CMS), according to Social Constructivism framework, is an opportunity for fostering learning through interaction in a virtual environment for learning; hence, stimulating the use of a CMS for communication purposes seems quite appropriate. A quantitative analysis of 63.06% of the virtual classrooms was conducted, using the users log database to describe five variables: Participation, Informational Interaction Level, Communicational Interaction Level, and the use of Informational Resources and Communicational Resources in the CMS. An assessment of the first 2 years of implementation of Moodle in a campus confirmed prominence levels of interaction and resources that favor Information over Communication purposes in the use of the CMS. It is not conclusive whether this necessarily implies more or better learning; a profound qualitative study would be needed to answer these questions. Teachers and students show different behaviors in the face of this new ICT campus resource, while faculty members appear to have behaved in an erratic manner, students show steady levels of CMS usage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)/Open Educational Systems development projects abound in higher education today. Many universities worldwide have adopted open source software like ATutor and Moodle as an alternative to commercial or homegrown systems. The move to open source learning management systems entails many special considerations, including usage analysis facilities. The tracking of users and their activities poses major technical and analytical challenges within web-based systems. This paper examines how user activity tracking challenges are met with data mining techniques, particularly web usage mining methods, in four different open learning management systems: ATutor, LON-CAPA, Moodle, and Sakai. As examples of data mining technologies adapted within widely used systems, they represent important first steps for moving educational data mining outside the research laboratory. Moreover, as examples of different open source development contexts, exemplify the potential for programmatic integration of data mining technology processes in the future. As open systems mature in the use of educational data mining, they move closer to the long-sought goal of achieving more interactive, personalized, adaptive learning environments online on a broad scale. © 2010, IGI Global.

Many methods are used to enhance student engagement in instructional nursing education courses, and systems are introduced as new technologies become available. The aim of this research was to evaluate student's experiences of the use of an Audience Response System (ARS) - aka Clickers - in the laboratory setting and determine if it improved student knowledge retention and contributed to the body of research in this area. Students used handheld RF devices to respond to PowerPoint questions in relation to wound care and management. This approach helped to focus student's attention and provide feedback on student's comprehension of material. Use of ARS devices facilitated preparation for an in-class Moodle quiz. Focused ARS questions helped students maintain attention and stay motivated to learn. Feedback allowed clinical skills facilitators to adapt laboratory sessions to address areas of deficiency.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of a proposed computer-based instructional method in Primary Education for self-regulated problem solving. The proposed instructional method is based on Sternberg's model of problem solving within an authentic context. It consists of three main phases: observation, collaboration and semi-structured guidance. The ultimate learning objective is to augment the autonomous problem-solving skills of primary school children. In our study the Synergo tool was used, which is a synchronous computer supported collaborative learning tool, as well as the Moodle learning management system. The context which frames the method is authentic, very close to a students' realistic learning situation. The findings of this study advocate that students can increase their problem-solving skills in a relatively short period of time. At the same time, they can improve their approach to the solution of a given mathematical problem, performing significant signs of autonomy. © 2009.

A course disk in either CD or DVD format can be very beneficial to online, hybrid, or distance courses in statistics as well as traditional on-campus courses, augmenting existing technologies like course management systems. A typical course disk may include the syllabus and course outline, calendar, instructions, lecture notes and lecture outlines, handouts, assignments, interactive content such as quizzes and surveys, software, statistical tables, example program files, program code, data files, video lectures and tutorials, and pertinent website links. In most cases, a course disk would be used in addition to traditional methods like course management systems rather than in place of these traditional methods. Most of the benefits of a course disk are shared with course management systems like Blackboard or Moodle; however, a course disk has the distinct advantages that it need not rely on internet access and it provides access to course materials after a course has ended. One course disk was developed and used in teaching a graduate-level introductory statistical methods course in three different settings: distance learning off-campus condensed course, online course, and traditional on-campus course. The course disk provided a variety of benefits across delivery formats as well as benefits unique to each delivery format. This article will (1) review relevant literature, (2) describe the course disk and compare its use to other content delivery methods, (3) discuss the experiences and evaluation of using the course disk in three different settings and how the students in each setting benefited from using the course disk, and (4) discuss the necessary hardware and software and the process of making a course disk. © 2010 by Jamis J.

Three major mining education providers implemented in 2007 a highly innovative approach to educating mining engineers in Australia with the establishment of Mining Education Australia (MEA). In July 2006 a Joint Venture Agreement was signed between the three universities: Curtin University of Technology, The University of New South Wales, and The University of Queensland. An important aspect of MEA is the linkage with industry which through the Minerals Council of Australia has provided significant financial support. MEA is a world first collaborative undergraduate mining program that provides a common curriculum for the final two years of the four year degree program. The program has incorporated a range of collaborative teaching and learning tools. For example as each partner university has a different learning management system, MEA registered its own web domain within Moodle in mid-2007. In 2008 the majority of the courses used Moodle as the common learning management system in MEA. Most MEA courses also use a project and/or problem based learning approach resulting in more group work by students. This required a strategy to ensure group work standards were consistent across the program including peer assessment. As part of this, MEA trialed different peer assessment tools such as iPeer and SPARK and is investigating new tools for learning/teaching such as online and digitally mediated tools. This paper describes the collaboration success of MEA and also discusses the teaching and learning management systems and peer assessment tools used across the MEA universities. © Common Ground, Serkan Saydam, Rudrajit Mitra, Chris Daly, Paul Hagan.

Teaching and learning with ICT requires specific competencies for teachers and lectures. Too much attention was given to the technological aspects. Teachers learned to work with hard- and software. A typical example is the European Computer Driving License (ECDL). A lot of people attend courses on text processing, spreadsheets... but using a Virtual Learning Environment like e.g. Blackboard or Moodle demands more didactical than technical skills. Especially e-learning and blended learning is too demanding to let teachers learn to use these tools only by experimenting. More and more is generally accepted that the e-learning competencies for teachers require a longer course. Which competences and how these can be realized is the main focus of this paper? Besides the theoretical background, two examples will be showed.

As we overcome the instruction paradigm and face the need to promote a student centered model of teaching and learning, educational software are already easier to use, allow interactivity, promote the disjunction of time and space and make possible different modes, like image, sound and video to be incorporated in educational materials and environments. Drawing on multimodal literacy perspective of learning and pedagogy, this paper focuses on the subject New Technologies Applied to Education taught in a teacher initial training program. It discusses the effects of the use of Moodle and other technology learning tools in the construction of a student centered environment of learning. Specifically, this research closely observes four domains of student's (inter)action: Moodle activities (forum, and wikipedia), student's hands on work group outcomes (educational web, blog and webquest) and the course's blog (tintafrescavlog.blogspot.com), the latter a non evaluative activity. Results show that when technology's possibilities come from being virtual into being actual, social relations established among teachers, students and knowledge are restructured and, within this context, student's learning capability goes much further than the teaching one. It is argued it has come the time to rethink education so as to allow students not only to consume, but also to produce and distribute semiotic resources, taking a more active and critical role in their learning process. © Common Ground, Janaina Minelli de Oliveira, Mar Camacho Martí, Mercè Gisbert Cervera.

If education is to become culturally appropriate and improve environmental, societal and economic conditions, it needs to consider that current cultural development across the globe is increasingly connected with the use of new information and communication technologies (ICT). A close analysis of a blended higher vocational education course design and its two annual implementation cycles in different schools shows that careful introduction of ICT can have a positive impact in an educational context from the perspective of sustainability; new-media affirmative teaching and learning methods can increase both the hour-per-credit value of a course and student satisfaction. Current discussions about time management and students' workload and a symptomatic local situation concerning sustainability issues in Slovenian education show that integrating ICT into models and practices of sustainability should not only remain a profoundly disputed topic within reflections about sustainability in education, but also become an important practical method for achieving its goals.

Innovative use of web 2.0 tools by forward-thinking teachers can help engage the digital generation. Modern pupils use web 2.0 tools extensively, using applications such as instant messaging, Facebook, MySpace and Wikipedia every day to create content, communicate and collaborate with people worldwide. Hence the need for more training and education of teachers is necessary to best identify how to use them within the learning experience. Applications such as the open-source Moodle Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) are also experiencing increased uptake in UK schools, enabling teachers to enrich lessons with digital content and allowing 24/7 access to course-related assignments and learning resources. Schools need to be equipped with a network backbone that can simultaneously support web 2.0 tools in the classroom, video-conferencing in the boardroom, administration systems in the school office and wi-fi in the playground.

Research and commercial interest toward 3D virtual worlds are recently growing because they probably represent the new direction for the next generation of web applications. Although these environments present several features that are useful for informal collaboration, structured collaboration is required to effectively use them in a working or in a didactical setting. This paper presents a system supporting synchronous collaborative learning by naturally enriching Learning Management System services with meeting management and multimedia features. Monitoring and moderation of discussions are also managed at a single group and at the teaching level. The Second Life (SL) environment has been integrated with two ad hoc developed Moodle plug-ins and SL objects have been designed, modeled, and programmed to support synchronous role-based collaborative activities. We also enriched SL with tools to support the capturing and displaying of textual information during collaborative sessions for successive retrie al.In addition, the multimedia support has been enhanced with functionalities for navigating multimedia contents. We also report on an empirical study aiming at evaluating the use of the proposed SL collaborative learning as compared with face-to-face group collaboration. Results show that the two approaches are statistically undistinguishable in terms of performance, comfort with communication, and overall satisfaction. ©2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

With rapid emergence to the birth of the knowledge era, an active and interactive learning environment is fundamental to any teaching and learning process. Over time, negative implications of traditional learning environment are mounting, and measures must be taken to challenge it. With extensive research on available learning tools, it has become more feasible to provide our students with better learning opportunities. Such was the anticipation in the Malaysian educational context. Hence, this paper aims to address qualitative findings of a study on self-regulated learning strategies conveyed through the proposed interactive e-learning community (iELC). In duration of eight weeks, students (n = 50) from regular national secondary schools were subjected to online learning tasks aimed to advance strategies on self-regulated learning. To date, strategies of self-regulated learning have been perceived as key to learner to succeed academically and after the schooling years. By means of semi-structured interview, data were collected from small group and one-to-one perception. Results were directed at the overall development of self-regulated learning strategies and its diffusion in the iELC discussion platform. Conclusively, these findings add significantly to the understanding of self-regulated learning strategies in an online learning environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although distance learning is widely adopted nowadays, the computer Course Management Systems (CMS) dominate the field of Web-based Instructional Systems (WbIS) design and the role of the educational specialist in developing these systems is marginal. Thus, a new tool is needed to enable the educationalists to apply their theories in the field of WbIS design. Indeed, WbIS design needs a common framework that includes all participants in the project. Furthermore, a methodology is needed in order to apply it during course design. This paper investigates the possibility of designing a project using Activity Theory (AT) as a framework infusing constructivist environment and educational theories that could increase the opportunities of optimal user experience. Indeed, usability is concerned with the quality of an interactive computer system with respect to ease of learning, ease of use, and user satisfaction. Thus, the objective is to develop web-based courses that are easy to learn, effective to use and provide an optimal user experience. The study aims at better analysis and design of Web-based Instructional Systems as well as better evaluation of the user experience with these learning environments. It introduces a real case study for an education technology web-based course designed adopting the AT as a framework and implemented using the Moodle CMS. The optimal experience of learners is evaluated and the results are statistically analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package. Several future research directions are suggested that need contribution and further cooperation between computer scientists specially people concerned with Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Web engineers, as well as, Educational specialists. © Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt.

Telepathology in the Republic of Georgia is still evolving. Although much progress has been made around the world, especially in the field of digital imaging and virtual slides, telepathology in Georgia still revolves around static telepathology. The results of the NATO Networking Infrastructure Grant "ePathology-Virtual Pathology Center in Georgia as the continuation of Virtual Health Care Center" are presented. It is a practical implementation of telepathology in Georgia as a best practice example. Using basic methodology: idea-analysis-conception-implementation-test/deployment, the ePathology server was created for the establishment of telepathology in Georgia. Two main services were made available on the server: Simple Machines Forum (eConsultation) and Moodle (eLearning) under the premise "keep it small, safe, and simple." The ePathology server works well. By its application, introduction of the Pap-smear technique and 2001 Bethesda System for reporting cervicovaginal cytologic diagnosis has been done. The application of easily available and adaptable technology, together with the improvement of the infrastructure conditions, is the essential basis for telemedical applications. Telepathology is a very useful and applicable tool for consulting on difficult pathology cases. It has significantly increased knowledge exchange and thereby ensured a better medical service. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009.

Problem-based learning (PBL) has proved to be a highly successful pedagogical model in many fields, although it is not that common in computer engineering. PBL goes beyond the typical teaching methodology by promoting student interaction. This paper presents a PBL trial applied to a course in a computer engineering degree at the University of Seville, Spain. To promote the reusability and interoperability of the PBL trial, a design-driven approach was used, based on the Internet protocol Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) Learning Design (LD) standard. This paper presents the outcomes of using this method to innovate teaching practices in a blended learning environment. Design and implementation results, as well as users' opinions, are presented and analyzed. © 2009 IEEE.

This work describes the application of subgroup discovery using evolutionary algorithms to the usage data of the Moodle course management system, a case study of the University of Cordoba, Spain. The objective is to obtain rules which describe relationships between the student's usage of the different activities and modules provided by this e-learning system and the final marks obtained in the courses. We use an evolutionary algorithm for the induction of fuzzy rules in canonical form and disjunctive normal form. The results obtained by different algorithms for subgroup discovery are compared, showing the suitability of the evolutionary subgroup discovery to this problem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The article deals with a corpus-based approach to teaching the English tense system in a Slovenian tertiary institution. In addition to offering online support (Moodle) in Business English courses taught at the Faculty of Management, University of Primorska, Business English teachers rely on corpus-based approach in their efforts to provide learning support to students trying to master the English tense system. Corpus-based approach in teaching represents a shift towards a learner-centred paradigm of discovery learning which enables students to test their own hypotheses and discover their own rules in the process of the so-called data-driven learning. In addition, corpus examples also expose students to sentences and structures that they will encounter when using the language in real-life business situations. Hard and fast rules regarding English tenses should be substituted by corpus-based data-driven hypothesis testing learner-centred notions. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Video games and new communication metaphors are quickly changing today's young people habits. Considering the actual e-learning scenarios, embedded in a fully technological enabled environment it is crucial to take advantage of this kind of capabilities to let learning process gain best results. This paper presents a virtual campus created using Second Life which provides four distinct types of virtual space: common student campus, collaborative zones, lecture rooms and recreational areas. Second Life environments and objects have been designed and programmed to support synchronous lectures and collaborative learning. The Second Life virtual world has also been equipped with supporting tools enabling students and teachers to navigate among multimedia contents. Second Life and an ad-hoc developed Moodle plug-in have been integrated to naturally enrich the environment with LMS services, exploiting this 3D world to increase the interaction and communication opportunities between teachers and students, and among students, principally favoring planned and unplanned social encounters. We have conducted an experiment involving university students aiming at evaluating Second Life synchronous distance lectures in the proposed learning environment. The evaluation has been conducted considering that, in a 3D multi-user virtual environment, learning is strongly related to the user perception of belonging to a learning community, as well as to the perception of awareness, presence and communication. The results of the evaluation are very positive. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Hungary, a lot of electronic-based syllabuses have been developed during the last 8-10 years at a most considerable cost. However, not much has been heard of their success or efficiency, as would be supported by scientific testing. First, the present study is to provide a survey of our project, which aimed at creating an integrated electronic learning environment. The processing of an education technology syllabus integrated in the Moodle virtual learning environment system took place in the passing academic year. The analysis of student behaviour in the learning environment is based on log files created on the server during the course of interaction between learners and the electronic syllabus. We analysed the learning activity of the students in the learning environment in exact numeric terms by using methods of web-mining. The second part of the study presents some of our first empirical results in this field.

In this paper, we present a case in which we integrated an intelligent tutoring system- ITS- in a basic mathematics course. The proposed ITS -PrivateTutor- is dynamic, web-based, adaptive, and interactive. It is composed of six different modules; each has a distinct function: student, domain, question, communication, expert, and controller modules. The purpose of this system is not to eliminate the role of human teachers, but to complement their effort in reaching all students and having one-to-one tutoring approach instead one-to-many. An experiment was conducted in order to study the effectiveness of PrivateTutor on class achievement. Students who were enrolled in a "Basic Mathematics" course in the Fall of 2005-2006 and Spring of 2006 at the Lebanese American University were randomly assigned to two groups: control and treatment. The experimental results failed to show any significant positive effect.

This paper describes a qualitative case study involving the formation of a number of facilitated action learning groups each comprising six teachers from different services in the New Zealand early childhood education sector. Action learning is a process that involves small groups or sets of learners working on issues or problems that they face in their professional contexts with the support of a facilitator. Although action learning sets most often meet face-to-face, ICT is increasingly being used to support or in some cases replace traditional set meetings. The participants in this study both meet face-to-face in facilitated workshops and interact online while back at their respective workplaces for ongoing reflection, discussion and the sharing of knowledge and resources. The open source software MOODLE is the enabling technology used in this study and the ICTs used include email, online reflective journals, forum discussions including online action learning forums, and chat sessions. The groups use an action learning process to learn about themselves as leaders and to work collaboratively on issues and challenges related to their leadership roles. Preliminary data from this study suggests that online action learning groups are a very effective model for use in leadership development. Some of the benefits of this model are that it: allows for an intensive professional learning experience while not requiring a large amount of scheduled meeting time; encourages both individual and shared reflection; supports participants to identify and take action on issues that they face in their everyday work; and builds communities of practice through the sharing of knowledge and the building of strong networks. This paper will also present an emerging model of online action learning which is based on the Community of Inquiry model (Garrison, Anderson & Archer 2000). The emerging model represents how the cognitive presence cycle of identifying, reflecting, deciding and acting is facilitated within the context of online action learning groups. The processes of sharing, supporting and questioning are conditions that allow the process of leadership learning to occur. Group members share experiences both personal and professional, provide support for each other and also challenge each other through the reflective questioning process. The facilitator also provides support and challenge and acts a role model for the action learning process.

Problem-based learning (PBL) has been implemented for years in lots of countries and the achieved performance is plausible. However, the implementation of PBL course often needs a lot of human resources; the instructors often need offering instructions to the learners intensively. As the modern computer science and the Internet gains wide popularity around the world, e-learning is taken by the learners as an important study aid and thereby lightens the burden of the instructors. In this research, we incorporate the PBL activity into an open software e-learning platform, Moodle, and a learning diagnosis tool is added in the platform to alleviate the loading of the instructors. The learners' transcripts posted on discussion board and chatting room are first preprocessed by the learning parameter extraction module to truly reflect the learners' planning on the solutions to the designated problem. The extracted parameters are further fed into a classification algorithm to examine the quality of the learners' suggestions and some appropriate feedback will be issued to the learners/instructor if needed. The experimental results show that the text mining and machine learning techniques used in this work are effective in automatically providing useful feedback for the learners to progress through the ill-structured problem solving. © 2007.

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss an expansion of the Special Education Bulgaria (SEB) internet community that is required to pilot software created by the European Union's (EU's) Sixth Framework integrated project, TENCompetence. Design/methodology/approach – SEB is the product of a two-year research project designed to create a sustainable nation-wide community of practice (CoP) for special education in Bulgaria via the internet. This paper discusses the SEB features consistent with TENCompetence concepts of competency development, lifelong learning, and professional networking. It then describes the additional features needed to prepare a SEB pilot. Findings – SEB was developed throughout three phases of research, which included a needs assessment, formative evaluation, and effectiveness evaluation. Effectiveness evaluation results indicated that though a CoP has begun to coalesce, it remains unclear to what extent SEB helps special educators do their jobs better. In response to this finding, the implementation and testing of e-portfolios and online courses is proposed. The implementation would employ Moodle for course management, Elgg or Mahara for e-portfolios, and TENCompetence open-source software for defining and organizing competencies. Research limitations/implications – Research outcomes regarding online communities and lifelong competency development may also apply to the professional development of special educators in neighbouring Balkan countries, especially those new to or soon to enter the EU. Originality/value – Internet-based competency development and lifelong learning for special educators in Bulgaria, one of the EU's newest member countries, is investigated. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

ISS adapted the Moodle e-leaming platform and implemented the problem-based learning (PBL) methodology. One clinical and one technical module were prepared by using traditional learning sources as well as interactive tools. Each module included 4 units; each unit was based on a 5-days cycle. The courses remained open from January to October 2006. Fifty percent of the registered students attended the courses. Traditional and interactive learning resources were equally used. Overall feedback was positive, unless for the amount of time requested for the study and the lack of an official certificate of attendance. Both modules are now in the process of being revised, improved and generalised, in order to be integrated into the ISS Rehabilitation website.

Educational data mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from the educational context. This work is a survey of the specific application of data mining in learning management systems and a case study tutorial with the Moodle system. Our objective is to introduce it both theoretically and practically to all users interested in this new research area, and in particular to online instructors and e-learning administrators. We describe the full process for mining e-learning data step by step as well as how to apply the main data mining techniques used, such as statistics, visualization, classification, clustering and association rule mining of Moodle data. We have used free data mining tools so that any user can immediately begin to apply data mining without having to purchase a commercial tool or program a specific personalized tool. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, two basic purposes are presented. First, taking effective feedbacks in the electronic learning environment about the learning level of students at the problem solving which are told in physics lessons and laboratories. Second, providing a possibility for students to repeat the subjects and solved problems by watching and listening, which are told in lessons and laboratories, whenever or wherever they want. For this purpose, in the first step, the problems solved in classroom and laboratories about physics and subject expressions are transferred to digital environment and e-learning materials are developed. In the second step, these materials are converted to standard SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) package and integrated to Course Management System (CMS).

Aim: To evaluate online elective courses at Croatian medical schools with respect to the virtual mobility of national teachers and students and virtual team collaboration. Methods: A student-centered virtual learning environment developed within the framework of the European Union Tempus Programme allowed national educational services to design and deliver online undergraduate elective courses. Three online elective courses were created for second-year medical students of four Croatian medical schools by using Moodle, an open-source learning management system. The courses supported problem-, project-, and decision-based learning and required students to work in small collaborative teams using problem-solving and decision-making activities. The purpose was to foster teamwork and produce better outcomes than those potentially achieved through individual work. We evaluated the results of these online courses on the basis of the course test results and students' evaluation questionnaires. Results: Of 68 students enrolled in all e-courses, 97% (n = 66) successfully passed the final exam. An anonymous online questionnaire was filled out by 83% (n = 50) of the students. The majority expressed their satisfaction with the online electives, mostly because they had more contact with tutors and peers (n = 47), better possibilities of self-assessment (n = 38), more flexible learning (n = 33), better access to learning materials (n = 32), faster and easier information retrieval (n = 31), and better quality of communication with tutors and peers (n = 28). Although 38 of 50 students claimed that participating in e-courses was more demanding than participating in traditional electives, more than half (n = 27) would enroll in an e-course again. Conclusion: Elective e-courses may be a successful model of how faculty and students at higher education institutions can collaborate and integrate e-learning into their current curricula.

Background: Acute medical management is an important component of the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) project which has recently been implemented in the UK. A web-based interactive course in acute medicine has been developed which complements the clinical teaching provided to senior medical students at the University of Glasgow. A study was undertaken to evaluate the teaching and assess the knowledge of acute medicine among final year medical students using an online questionnaire. Methods: The undergraduate medical school Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) was constructed using the Moodle learning management system. The online questionnaire was constructed as part of the interactive acute medicine course hosted on the VLE. Final year students using this course were asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess different aspects of acute medical management and evaluate the teaching. Results: From 210 students using the website, 99 (47.1%) completed the online questionnaire. Nephrology and neurology were identified as the most challenging specialties in acute medicine. The areas of acute management in which students felt they lacked most knowledge were drug overdose and acute renal failure. Drug prescribing was also identified as an area of the curriculum requiring further development. Conclusions: This approach to blended learning is popular with our medical students. Online evaluation has helped with curriculum development and, by identifying important areas of acute medicine teaching that can be improved, is feeding into our curriculum revision.

In the study of online learning community, many investigators have turned attention to automatically logged web data. This study aims to further this work by seeking to determine whether logs of student activity within online graduate level courses related to student perceptions of course community. Researchers utilized the data logging features of the Moodle learning management system and the Classroom Sense of Community Index. Results reveal that cumulative course data logs are predictive of both a student's sense of connectedness and student community. This study adds to a foundation for a non-invasive assessment of affective variables in online learning environments, and suggests a simple method for providing e-learning instructors with real-time feedback for fostering online community. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Philips Lighting have used a series a of short training books to keep its its staff up-to-date. The company decided to use online training to its staff as it has many potential benefits that include the ability to update the material regularly and control monitor access. The company decided to set up a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with University College London. KTP programs are supported by the government who pay some of the costs involved. Moodle was selected and the first module was created in August 2006. Moodle is an open-source Learning Management System (LMS), which provides vital information to the user, such as the list of modules they can access, together with their progress through the material and their grades in the quizzes associated with each module. The modules are grouped under various categories to help the user to adopt a particular learning path.

The pedagogical mediation in Distance Education (DE) is supported by principles such as interaction, cooperation and autonomy. We have investigated the potentiality of the hypermedia T-LVE and in the T-LO, utilized to implement these pedagogical principles. The Meaningful Learning Theory categories have been methodologically chosen to analyze the elaboration and implementation process of potentially meaningful didactic materials with interactive tools like Lesson (Moodle module) and Articulate Present/Quizmaker (integrated to Power Point). The theoretical-methodological results about the methods and tools of content adaptation in T-LVE and TLO clearly demonstrate the presence of the hypermedia character in these resources. We highlight that these interactive tools allow the systematized elaboration of hypermedia didactic materials. The Lesson and the Articulate provide connection between technological mediators, pedagogical principles and curricular contents. T-LVE and T-LO became potentially meaningful due to a didactic-methodological plan that includes progressive differentiation, integrative reconciliation, sequential organization and consolidation of the curricular contents.

In spite of their apparent benefits, learning management systems can be regarded as a hindrance to effective online learning. Their design, functionality, complexity, price, and value are beginning to be questioned by some users. As a new generation of Web-based tools and approaches evolves, Web-based learning management systems are becoming better suited to meet the need for dynamic online learning, interaction, collaboration, and networking. The new tools and collaborative approaches these systems provide allow learners to take proactive control of their own learning. In June 2004 a consortium of New Zealand Tertiary Institutions led by the Waikato Institute of Technology secured a one-year Ministry of Education grant to support the "Open Source Courseware Initiative New Zealand" (OSCINZ). The OSCINZ project focused on the development and implementation of "Moodle" (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) to create a uniquely New Zealand learning management system, based on quality open source code developed and tested by leading educational providers. This paper describes the response of faculty in three of the project's partner tertiary institutions to the implementation of Moodle in their institutions. © 2007 The Haworth Press, Inc.

Unlike conventional models of software development, the open source model is based on the collaborative efforts of users who are also co-developers of the software. Interest in open source software has grown exponentially in recent years. A Google search for the phrase open source in early 2005 returned 28.8 million webpage hits, while less than two years later that number had jumped to 376 million. This paper discusses the origin of the term open source and the key tenets of the open source software development model. In addition, it analyzes the merits and drawbacks of using this model and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of applying the model in higher education. Importantly, examples are provided of computer software, and course management systems in particular, developed using the open source model. Also included are brief analyses of the Linux operating system, and two open source course management systems, Sakai and Moodle, as well as the uPortal. A timeline of major open source projects of significance in North America is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential for applying the open source software development model to open and distance education.

This paper describes a blended learning approach in teaching "Constrained Time-Delayed Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control."It is based on the "learning by doing"paradigm supported by several e-learning tools: by the interactive electronic course materials in Moodle; by the laboratory of low-cost and easy-to-manipulate plants; and by the virtual laboratory WebLAB. These open the access to study and experiment on real systems via Internet for 24 h/day, seven days a week. Synergy of the newly structured theory developed to deal with real-world constraints with the interactive content delivery and with active learning based on simulations, real-time experiments in laboratories, and tele-experiments via Internet offers stimulating and quasi-authentic learning environment. These give students multiple formative feedback, ranging from computer quizzes to plant reactions in a rich variety of authentic situations. © 2007 IEEE.

In this paper, a methodological educational proposal based on constructivism and collaborative learning theories is described. The suggested approach has been successfully applied to a subject entitled "Computer Architecture and Engineering" in a Computer Science degree in the University of La Laguna in Spain. This methodology is supported by two tools: the Moodle platform as a collaboration framework among students and teachers and a free Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) processor simulator called SIMDE, developed by the authors to promote the experience and help the understanding of superscalar and VLIW processors. This work is described showing how the constructivist and collaborative approaches have been applied and how the activities have been structured temporarily in phases. This educational proposal has been validated and improved with the feedback of the students during two academic years. Furthermore, the methodological procedure is also suitable to be used not only in subjects with contents which require the understanding of dynamic situations but also in subjects with other requirements. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 2004, the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Samtse, Bhutan, has made systematic efforts to introduce information and communication technology (ICT) for learning support into its distance teacher education program. This article describes the early experiences of using ICT for distance education in Bhutan by teachers and students with relatively limited ICT background. It discusses the challenges of providing student support for a distance teacher education program in Bhutan and it explores the use of ICT for student support. The article also reports an assessment of student perceptions and readiness for ICT use, the introduction of a learning management system and regional study centers as ICT access points, and the experiences and challenges encountered in the process of ICT introduction in its early stages. The use of ICT by distance students based on log data from the learning management system Moodle and regional study centers are discussed, as well as the challenges of ICT use under infrastructure and technological support limitations.

Changes in the regulation of junior doctors' hours and in the design of medical career pathways have rendered the traditional weekly tutorial ineffective for teaching the core knowledge of emergency medicine. In this paper, the inception of a virtual leaning environment and the development of an online course for F2 doctors in our emergency department are described. The course, delivered in the open source Moodle virtual learning environment, allows us to reliably deliver educational content to all our juniors regardless of shift patterns. It provides insight into the effectiveness of that education, and records the students' activities and achievements to a level for beyond that achievable through traditional teaching methods.

Two studies are reported, comparing the browser loading times of webpages created using common Web development techniques. The loading speeds were estimated in 12 Asian countries by members of the PANdora network, funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to conduct collaborative research in the development of effective distance education (DE) practices. An online survey tool with stopwatch-type counter was used. Responses were obtained from Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In most of the survey conditions, browser loading times were noted up to four times slower than commonly prescribed as acceptable. Failure of pages to load at all was frequent. The speediest loading times were observed when the online material was hosted locally, and was created either in the Docebo learning management system (LMS), or in the HTML option provided by the Moodle LMS. It is recommended that formative evaluation of this type should become standard practice in the selection and use of online programming techniques, in order to preserve the accessibility of the World-Wide-Web across large geographical distances, as for DE in the developing world.

Nicephor[e] is a project funded by "Swiss Virtual Campus" and aims at creating a distant or mixed web-based learning system in forensic and scientific photography and microscopy. The practical goal is to organize series of on-line modular courses corresponding to the educational requirements of undergraduate academic programs. Additionally, this program could be used in the context of continuing educational programs. The architecture of the project is designed to guarantee a high level of knowledge in forensic and scientific photographic techniques, and to have an easy content production and the ability to create a number of different courses sharing the same content. The e-learning system Nicephor[e] consists of three different parts. The first one is a repository of learning objects that gathers all theoretical subject matter of the project such as texts, animations, images, and films. This repository is a web content management system (Typo3) that permits creating, publishing, and administrating dynamic content via a web browser as well as storing it into a database. The flexibility of the system's architecture allows for an easy updating of the content to follow the development of photographic technology. The instructor of a course can decide which modular contents need to be included in the course, and in which order they will be accessed by students. All the modular courses are developed in a learning management system (WebCT or Moodle) that can deal with complex learning scenarios, content distribution, students, tests, and interaction with instructor. Each course has its own learning scenario based on the goals of the course and the student's profile. The content of each course is taken from the content management system. It is then structured in the learning management system according to the pedagogical goals defined by the instructor. The modular courses are created in a highly interactive setting and offer autoevaluating tests to the students. The last part of the system is a digital assets management system (Extensis Portfolio). The practical portion of each course is to produce images of different marks or objects. The collection of all this material produced, indexed by the students and corrected by the instructor is essential to the development of a knowledge base of photographic techniques applied to a specific forensic subject. It represents also an extensible collection of different marks from known sources obtained under various conditions. It allows to reuse these images for creating image-based case files. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of two different educator-centric learning management systems (LMSs), Moodle and Manila, for radiology e-learning was formatively evaluated and the implications of the future use of LMSs in radiology education were explored. NeuroRAD, a neuroradiologic digital library and learning community, is implemented with Moodle, one of the most popular open-source educator-centric LMSs. Pediatric-Education.org, a pediatric digital library and learning community, is implemented with Manila, a commercial educator-centric LMS. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of these LMSs were performed with World Wide Web server log file statistical programs and user-submitted comment forms. In 2005, NeuroRAD was used by 9959 visitors, who read 98,495 pages of information, whereas PediatricEducation.org was used by 91,000 visitors, who read 186,000 pages of information. Visitors represented a wide spectrum of medical learners and used the sites to answer clinical questions; to prepare for lectures, conferences, and informal teaching sessions; and to stay up-to-date and prepare for examinations. Early results indicate that radiology learning communities can be implemented with educator-centric LMSs relatively easily and at low cost by radiologists with minimal computer expertise, and can find receptive and appreciative audiences. Online radiology learning communities could play a significant role in providing education to radiologists the world over throughout their careers. ©RSNA, 2007.

The paper presents an EU iCamp1 initiative, which aims at creating an iCamp Space, an open virtual learning environment for collaboration and networking across open source learning systems, countries, and disciplines in higher education. An insight into the technical and pedagogical issues of the initiative is provided. Pedagogically, the project is based on constructivist learning theories that put more emphasis on self-organised learning, social networking, and the changing roles of educators. Technically, different open source learning systems and tools are being connected, and interoperability provided amongst them. The main focus of this paper is on interoperability of open source learning management systems and learning repositories, and their integration into the iCamp Space. Examples of the first open source systems that have already been connected within iCamp are Moodle, .LRN, IVA, Open Course and Drupal.

© 2006 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. Trust and collective learning are useful features that are enabled by effective collaborative leadership of e-learning projects across higher and further education (HE/FE) institutions promoting lifelong learning. These features contribute effectively to the development of design for learning in communities of e-learning practice. For this, reflexivity, good leadership and the capacity to engage in innovation is crucial to team performance. This paper outlines a serendipitously useful combination of innovative models of collaboration emerging from two 2005-06 UK e-learning pilots: the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) e-Learning Independent Study Award (eLISA) and JISC infoNet Collaborative Approaches to the Management of e-Learning (CAMEL) projects. The JISC-funded eLISA Distributed e-Learning (DeL) project set up a collaborative partnership among teachers to try out LAMS and Moodle using study skills in e-learning. Simultaneously, the JISC infoNet CAMEL project developed a model of collaborative approaches to e-learning leadership and management across four UK HE/FE institutions. This paper proposes two new theoretical collaborative team leadership and operational models for e-learning projects, including indices of trust, reflexivity and shared procedural knowledge, recommending that these models are further developed in future communities of e-learning practice in institutions promoting lifelong learning.

Starting from the first public draft of IMS Learning Design in November 2002, a research project at the Catholic University Eichstaett-Ingolstadt in Germany was dedicated to the conceptual examination and empirical review of IMS Learning Design Level A. A prototypical runtime environment called 'lab005' was developed. It was built based on Moodle, a web-based, open source course management system. Development and use of the lab005 runtime environment were intensely evaluated. Several university courses provided a use case for the empirical review of IMS Learning Design, which covered mainly two issues: firstly, whether IMS Learning Design can be used to support mixed mode learning scenarios (use for blended learning), and secondly, how users interact in learning situations with a learning environment for IMS Learning Design (usability in terms of human-computer interaction). This article gives an overview of the web-based learning environment lab005, its underlying concepts and outcomes of experimental use and evaluation. Though limited in scope, the successful implementation of IMS Learning Design in higher education proves the possibility to support mixed mode learning scenarios. Key concepts for the graphical user interface of lab005 are illustrated in order to give insights into the use of IMS Learning Design in mixed mode learning scenarios. Details in the results of evaluation concern the classification of learning objects, the use of environment as an element in IMS Learning Design and challenges in the application with face-to-face situations and with real life objects in classroom learning scenarios.

Our focus is on the effectiveness of e-learning, reflecting on our experiences both as tutees and tutors. The paper considers these two strands, culminating in an overview of the enablers and inhibitors of this learning medium. In the first strand, an ethnographic study is discussed, involving 36 students on a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) programme. The major assessment of this course involved the use of an e-learning environment known as Moodle. An e-conference by means of Moodle was used to facilitate group discussions and to inform assignment writing. On reflection, the approach proved effective for both communication and comprehension. It circumvented the potential problems of group meetings and helped overcome other common communication difficulties. However, conversely, it also suggested that a drawback of e-conferencing might be the absence of nuances in speech and body language. In the second strand, the paper considers the delivery of e-learning at UCE Birmingham and in particular the built environment subject area. This is based on the authors' participation as tutors. The role of Moodle as a tool in delivering effective teaching is addressed specifically, outlining some of the successes and glitches encountered so far. Using a student satisfaction survey and interviews with staff members who have used Moodle, the authors reflect on some of the inhibitors that slow the uptake of e-learning as a broader pedagogical approach. Workshops, one-to-one discussions and induction programmes are seen as methods of facilitating the broader uptake of e-learning. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Nowadays, open source e-learning applications are complete and reliable solutions that are in no case inferior to the commercial ones. Though gratis, they offer unique advantages such as support of various operating systems and the chance to experiment with their source code. Additionally, there is a vast community of developers willing to aid users in installing or using these systems. Besides the fact that they are of excellent quality, open source Learning Management Systems (LMSs) such as Dokeos, Moodle, ILIAS and ATutor can be easily adapted to new demands and challenges thus gaining popularity. This paper initially presents an authoring methodology of SCORM lessons in the Greek language which can be applicable to any of the aforementioned systems. Moreover, it focuses on Dokeos and proposes a new extension of this system in order to meet synchronous communication requirements such as videoconferencing and streaming video.
