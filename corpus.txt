This paper develops a formal model of the subtle meaning differences that exist between grammatical alternatives in socially conditioned variation (called variants) and how these variants can be used by speakers as resources for constructing personal linguistic styles. More specifically, this paper introduces a new formal system, called social meaning games (SMGs), which allows for the unification of variationist sociolinguistics and game-theoretic pragmatics, two fields that have had very little interaction in the past. Although remarks have been made concerning the possible usefulness of game-theoretic tools in the analysis of certain kinds of socially conditioned linguistic phenomena (Goffman in Encounters: Two studies in the sociology of interaction, Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, 1961; in Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face interaction, Aldine, Oxford, 1967; in Strategic interaction, vol 1, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1970; Bourdieu in Soc Sci Inf 16(6):645–668, 1977; Dror et al. in Lang Linguist Compass 7(11):561–579, 2013; in Lang Linguist Compass 8(6):230–242, 2014; Clark in Meaningful games: Exploring language with game theory, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2014, among others), a general framework uniting game-theoretic pragmatics and quantitative sociolinguistics has yet to be developed. This paper constructs such a framework through giving a formalization of the Third Wave approach to the meaning of variation (see Eckert in Ann Rev Anthropol 41:87–100, 2012, for an overview) using signalling games (Lewis in Convention, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1969) and a probabilistic approach to speaker/listener beliefs of the kind commonly used in the Bayesian game-theoretic pragmatics framework (see Goodman and Lassiter in Probabilistic semantics and pragmatics: Uncertainty in language and thought.

The English words for daily meals constitute a complex lexical variable conditioned by social and linguistic factors. Comparative sociolinguistic analysis of 884 speakers from more than a dozen locations in Ontario, Canada reveals a synchronic system with social correlates that are reflexes of the British and American founder populations of the province. Toronto and Loyalist settlements in southern Ontario use the highest rates of dinner while northerners with European and Scots-Irish roots use supper. Dinner is taking over as the dominant form among younger speakers, exposing a cascade pattern (Trudgill 1972; Labov 2007) that is consistent with sociolinguistic typology (Trudgill 2011). © John Benjamins Publishing Company

This study investigates sociolinguistic variation in teacher classroom speech. Based on a spoken-French corpus produced by 59 teachers while teaching secondary school students (aged approximately 14–17 years) in four Ontario localities, it examines five cases of variant alternations. First, the study uses two comparative corpora to establish the social marking of the variants in the wider community. Second, it examines the teachers’ repertoire and frequency of use of variants in light of their social markedness. The study shows that the teachers use the standard variants at rates above even those found in the speech of the highest social strata within the wider community. Despite this normalizing impact of the classroom, the teachers also use all the non-standard variants found in the wider community. Further, the study examines the impact on the teachers’ variant choice exerted by their socio-professional characteristics and the communicative functions they perform in the classroom. It shows that the teachers’ use of variants is influenced by their gender, the subject taught, and the communicative functions performed in the classroom in ways that are in line with the social markedness of the variants in the wider community. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This paper introduces MadSex, a spoken corpus of 54 sociolinguistic interviews in Spanish based on the topic of sexuality. It was collected in order to study the cognitive sociolinguistic variation of sexual concepts. The paper presents and justifies methodological decisions taken during design, collection and transcription stages. Informants were selected in Madrid, based on a pre-stratified sample divided by sex, age and level of education. The interview methodology relied on an opinion questionnaire designed for the indirect elicitation of sexual concepts, which overcame successfully the limitations imposed by the low frequencies of semantic variables in discourse and the impact of sexual taboo in interaction. Relevant aspects of fieldwork, empathy and ethical protocols are also detailed in the paper. Transcription and markup are explained. Finally, an overview of the corpus is given, as well as some research papers based on it. Examples of the questionnaire are also provided. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

In this paper I present a framework for the conceptualization of languages based on the prototype theory of categorization proposed by Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues for natural semantic categories. It is motivated by research in the Casamance region of southern Senegal, where a high level of multilingualism in non-standardized varieties is the norm, making accurate description of languages, and thus analysis of multilingual discourse, problematic. I show that languages in this context can be conceived of as categories, of which linguistic features may be more or less prototypical members. Such an approach can form the basis for a more robust method of language description, integrating rich sociolinguistic data, and facilitating more nuanced analysis of multilingual discourse data. © UK Cognitive Linguistics Association 2019.

This paper provides a review of past research on children's acquisition of sociolinguistic variation and the impact that variable input has on the acquisition of grammatical morphology. I describe findings from both corpus studies and experimental studies, focusing primarily on the acquisition of variably produced plural morphology and subject-verb agreement. I make two predictions: (i) variable input impacts the time course of acquisition, such that variably produced morphology takes longer to acquire than non-variably produced morphology. And, (ii) variable input does not impact patterns of acquisition. Regardless of input-type, children pass through the same developmental linguistic stages. © 2019 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

Contrary to Labov's principle of style shifting, studies in language obsolescence portray speakers of dying languages as 'monostylistic', a characterization questioned here. Variationist methodology is adopted in a context of gradual language death. By combining quantitative and interactional analyses of data from older, younger, and new speakers of Francoprovençal in France and Switzerland, the article considers (a) to what extent variability in language obsolescence differs from that found in 'healthy' languages, and (b) how innovations might spread through communities speaking threatened languages characterized as 'monostylistic' and lacking overt normative infrastructure. It is argued that style variation (not monostylism) emerges from linguistic decay: among more fluent speakers, a categorical rule of /l/-palatalization before obstruents becomes underspecified, rendering palatalization available for strategic use. Among new speakers, novel palatal variants form part of an emergent sociolinguistic norm. The study offers fresh insights on the origins of sociolinguistic variation with implications for variationist theory.

What is the relationship between ethnolinguistic communities and ways of speaking? Who is an authentic speaker of an ethnolinguistic variety? In a time where scholarly and public conceptualizations of race and ethnicity are variable and rapidly changing, potential effects on both self-identification and ways of speaking present an area ripe for study. However, linguistics and allied fields have often overlooked individuals and communities that do not neatly conform to well-defined racial categories. As multiracially identified individuals are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the United States, researchers will necessarily need to address the way that traditional methodologies have excluded individuals and groups who fall outside of these racial and ethnic categories. This presents a unique challenge for sociolinguistics in particular, since we are interested in how people draw on linguistic variation to perform aspects of their identities, including their races and ethnicities. This article examines the ways in which race and ethnicity have been traditionally conceptualized in linguistics and allied fields and draws on research from other social sciences to see how they have begun to study individuals who fall outside of traditionally preexisting social categories. The article also briefly discusses the results of one of the first major sociolinguistic studies on multiracially identified participants, which found substantial effects of self-conceptualization and self-identification on linguistic behavior of these participants, a result which informs how future work should consider individuals who identify as two or more races. Finally, it will address future directions for research at the intersection of personal identity, race, and language. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

In the study of liaison acquisition, a key line of inquiry has focused on potential differences and similarities between L1 and L2 French speakers. However, such a comparison encounters a number of difficulties such as matching learners in terms of language exposure, age, and learning abilities. This study addresses these issues based on the analysis of French liaison in a series of experimental tasks performed by L1 children aged two to six, and by adult Korean learners of French as a foreign language. Results show that, for both groups, acquisition of categorical liaison precedes acquisition of variable liaison. However, when L1 and L2 learners are matched individually based on the results of a production task, they differ in a judgment task involving the perception of liaison. More specifically, the ability to judge the correctness of liaison precedes the ability to produce it in L2 learners, but not in L1 children. The findings provide a strong indication that L2 learners follow a specific process when acquiring liaison. © John Benjamins Publishing Company

Current research shows that listeners are generally accurate at estimating speakers’ age from their speech. This study investigates the effect of speaker first language and the role played by such speaker characteristics as fundamental frequency and speech rate. In this study English and Japanese first language speakers listened to English- and Japanese-accented English speech and estimated the speaker’s age. We find the highest correlation between real and estimated speaker age for English listeners listening to English speakers, followed by Japanese listeners listening to both English and Japanese speakers, with English listeners listening to Japanese speakers coming last. We find that Japanese speakers are estimated to be younger than the English speakers by English listeners, and that both groups of listeners estimate male speakers and speakers with a lower mean fundamental frequency to be older. These results suggest that listeners rely on sociolinguistic information in their speaker age estimations and language familiarity plays a role in their success. © The Author(s) 2019.

Received Pronunciation (RP) holds prestige not only in the UK, but also in many Outer and Expanding Circle countries and, even in the US, but the TRAP-BATH split (TBS) in RP, which refers to the shift from the vowel /a/ to / /, has still remained ambiguous because this sound shift contains inconsistent realizations that occur in identical codas, as illustrated in such lexical pairs as class but gas, path but math, last but enthusiast. What makes this sound feature more complicated is sociolinguistic variation. Although earlier discoveries have enhanced our understanding of the TBS, neither a definitive word list nor lexical frequency are provided for learners to enunciate BATH words. To provide RP learners with a linguistic index to learn BATH lexical set, this study expanded Wells's study by including additional 16 phonetic environments, which generated a total of 304 relevant words for examining their pronunciation defined by dictionaries. The findings show that 13 out of the 30 environments can trigger the TBS more than 50% of the time. In particular, seven of them can completely predict the TBS (over 91%), and one of them can fully do so (83%). This feature appears as a regular conditioned sound pattern if well-defined by its phonetic environments. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

This study explores the role of dialect-contact among developing L2 phonologies, and the influence of L1 ± ATR system on L2 English tense/lax vowels, using the under-documented Ebira English spoken in Nigeria as an exemplar. The variety presents an interesting precedent due to its differential historical contact with Yoruba English, starting in the early colonial periods, and Hausa English, becoming more prominent in the past three decades. This is relevant because the two dialects differ in degree of acoustic distinction of the tense-lax high vowel pairs, with Yoruba English being reported as having a merger, and Hausa English reported as having differentiation. Framed by theories of L2 speech and evolutionary approaches to language change, sociophonetic procedures are deployed to measure the high front and back vowels in Ebira English, as well as assess the trajectory of sociolinguistic variation within the variety. If it is the case that increased contact with Hausa English in the past three decades is influencing Ebira English vowels, a shift in apparent time away from merger and towards distinction would be expected. This would also be the case if the ± ATR distinction in Ebira have substrate effects on the realisation of English tense/lax vowels. The evidence of contrast between the high front (FLEECE & KIT) and back (GOOSE & FOOT) vowels thus confirm these predictions, while variation in the system is further indicated by gender and linguistic contexts. © 2019 The Author

Results from a crowdsourced audio questionnaire show that inflected infinitives in Galician are acceptable in a broad range of contexts, different from those described for European Portuguese. Crucially, inflected infinitives with referential subjects are widely accepted only inside strong islands in Galician (complements of nouns, adjunct clauses). They are widely rejected in non-islands, notably in the complements of epistemic/factive verbs, in contrast with Portuguese and older varieties of Galician (Gondar, 1978; Raposo, 1987). Statistical analysis shows, however, that, in the complements of epistemic/factive (and desiderative) verbs, inflected infinitives are significantly more acceptable in instances of control, whether partial or exhaustive. In fact, there is no significant difference between these two types of control in Galician, unlike in Portuguese, where inflection is generally better in instances of partial control and is not acceptable in instances of exhaustive local subject control (Modesto, 2010; Sheehan, 2018a). We propose an analysis of this pattern in terms of phase theory. The inflectional domain of non-finite clauses remains visible to the thematic domain of the next clause up, according to the less strict version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky, 2001), allowing control to take place. Pronouns/or pronominal inflections in the inflectional domain of visible non-finite clauses therefore get controlled. In islands, however, material in the inflectional domain remains free/referential. Despite this basic pattern, the data are characterized by substantial interspeaker variation. Statistical analysis shows that gender, urban/rural birthplace and mother tongue are all significant factors in this variation, while age and region of birth are not. Most notably, urban-born male bilinguals with Spanish as their mother tongue consistently rate all sentences higher on the Likert scale. Overall, the results show that crowdsourcing can lead to empirically robust syntactic descriptions of minority languages which are likely to be subject to substantial sociolinguistic variation and where judgments from a single social group may be misrepresentative of the general picture. The study also highlights, however, the challenges associated with using crowdsourced audio-questionnaires of this kind and the need for statistical analysis of results to control for substantial amounts of variation. © 2019 Sheehan, Schäfer and Parafita Couto.

In this essay, Anni Sairio explores sociolinguistic variation and change in Elizabeth Montagu's personal letters from the 1730s to the 1780s. Corpus analysis of the letters focuses on language features with normative and (in)formal connotations. The language of Montagu's letters changed considerably in the 1750s and 1760s, which indicates that her position in the Bluestocking network and her new social role had linguistic influence. On the one hand, preposition stranding all but disappeared as her social status became more prominent. On the other hand, Montagu's spelling became increasingly informal over the years, which suggests a kind of indifference to the ongoing language standardization. Contracted and abbreviated spellings were also more frequent in her letters to women. Life events, social relationships, and macrolevel linguistic developments all play a part in the variation and change of Montagu's language.

Taiwanese, a variety of Southern Min, is a dialect spoken in Taiwan with a pervasive tone sandhi system. To speak Taiwanese fluently and appropriately, one has to frequently apply Taiwanese tone sandhi. While it is common knowledge that tone sandhi is pervasive in spoken Taiwanese, there are no studies reporting on the rate of Taiwanese tone sandhi in spoken corpora in any genre. This paper attempts to determine the average tone sandhi rates of L1 Taiwanese dominant speakers and L1 Taiwanese L2 Mandarin bilinguals by analyzing a spoken corpus. Our study shows that the two groups do not reveal any significant differences in their tone sandhi application rate. On average, out of every 100 syllables, approximately 67 syllables have undergone tone sandhi. Regarding the application rates of individual tone sandhi rules, all speakers show a consistency as to which rules are most common and which are not. Consequently, one implication of our study is that L2 Mandarin fluency does not impact L1 Taiwanese tone sandhi frequency. Other implications help make clear the specific nature of the Taiwanese tone sandhi system. © 2019, National Taiwan Normal University. All Rights Reserved.

Human vocalizations contain both voice characteristics that convey who is talking and sophisticated linguistic structure. Inter-talker variation in voice characteristics is traditionally seen as posing a challenge for infant language learners, who must disregard this variation when the task is to detect talkers’ shared linguistic conventions. However, talkers often differ markedly in their pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. This is true even in monolingual environments, given factors like gender, dialect, and proficiency. We therefore asked whether infants treat the voice characteristics distinguishing talkers as a cue for learning linguistic conventions that one talker may follow more closely than another. Supporting this previously untested hypothesis, 12-month-olds did not freely combine two talkers’ sentences distinguished by voice to more robustly learn the talkers’ shared grammar rules. Rather, they used this voice information to learn rules to which only one talker adhered, a finding replicated in same-aged infants with greater second language exposure. Both language groups generalized the rules to novel sentences produced by a novel talker. Voice characteristics can thus help infants learn and generalize talker-dependent linguistic structure, which pervades natural language. Results are interpreted in light of theories linking language learning with voice perception. © 2018

Sociolinguists study the interaction between language and society. Variationist sociolinguistics — the subfield of sociolinguistics which is the focus of this issue — uses empirical and quantitative methods to study the production and perception of linguistic variation. Linguistic variation refers to how speakers choose between linguistic forms that say the same thing in different ways, with the variants differing in their social meaning. For example, how frequently someone says fishin’ or fishing depends on a number of factors, such as the speaker's regional and social background and the formality of the speech event. Likewise, if listeners are asked to use a rating scale make judgements about speakers who say fishin’ or fishing, their ratings depend on what other social characteristics are attributed to the speaker. This issue aims to reflect the growing number of interactions that bring variationist sociolinguistics into contact of different branches of cognitive science. After presenting current trends in sociolinguistics, we identify five areas of contact between the two fields: cognitive sociolinguistics, sociolinguistic cognition, acquisition of variation, computational modeling, and a comparative approach of variation in animal communication. We then explain the benefits of interdisciplinary work: fostering the study of variability and cultural diversity in cognition; bringing together data and modeling; understanding the cognitive mechanisms through which sociolinguistic variation is processed; examining indexical meaning; exploring links between different levels of grammar; and improving methods of data collection and analysis. Finally we explain how the articles in this issue contribute to each of these benefits. We conclude by suggesting that sociolinguistics holds a strategic position for facing the challenge of building theories of language through integrating its linguistic, cognitive, and social aspects at the collective and individual levels. © 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

How do our expectations about speakers shape speech perception? Adults’ speech perception is influenced by social properties of the speaker (e.g., race). When in development do these influences begin? In the current study, 16-month-olds heard familiar words produced in their native accent (e.g., “dog”) and in an unfamiliar accent involving a vowel shift (e.g., “dag”), in the context of an image of either a same-race speaker or an other-race speaker. Infants’ interpretation of the words depended on the speaker's race. For the same-race speaker, infants only recognized words produced in the familiar accent; for the other-race speaker, infants recognized both versions of the words. Two additional experiments showed that infants only recognized an other-race speaker's atypical pronunciations when they differed systematically from the native accent. These results provide the first evidence that expectations driven by unspoken properties of speakers, such as race, influence infants’ speech processing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Representations of the Appalachian region since the Civil War have cast its people in a uniformly negative light, a perception extended to the region's speech, generally regarded as Southern. Determining the geographic borders of the "true" Appalachia may be a futile quest, but an empirical assessment of the "Southernness" of Appalachian Englishes is an accomplishable goal. Traditional representations of Appalachia speech, often propagated by outsiders to disenfranchise its speakers, need to be reconciled with the divergent language patterns actually found in the region. This article first discusses some of the dialect research on English varieties in Appalachia to provide context for the reconciling of dialectological maps with sociolinguistic evaluations of language variation patterns. Second, the article provides a quantitative exploration of morphological and phonological sociolinguistic variation in West Virginia, the one state that falls squarely within Appalachia and contains many of its dialectological transition zones. Overall, the article explores the sociolinguistic patterns swirling within Appalachia around "Southernness" and reveals the actual diversity of Appalachians and the wide range of variation in their speech across both Southern and Northern patterns.

This paper reports on language practices in the city of Strasbourg, in a multi-ethnic working class neighbourhood. This provides a comparative setting to identify whether linguistic features are spreading between French cities. Data were collected from young speakers (16 to 21) using an ethnographic approach over a year. First, this paper will briefly review the literature on language variation research in France. Second, a comparison of vernacular features will be carried out, focusing on lexical innovations, indirect questions following the verb savoir (Gardner-Chloros and Secova, this issue), quotative systems (Cheshire and Secova, this issue) and discourse markers. Finally, the ethnographic data collected as part of this research will be used to consider how multi-ethnic working class neighbourhoods in France are connected with each other, and how language may be travelling between settings. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.

The study of style within the variationist tradition of Sociolinguistics has been ancillary until very recently despite this centrality in sociolinguistic variation: it has been merely used as an independent variable (extralinguistic parameter) in the correlation of linguistic and extralinguistic variables, rather than as a sociolinguistic resource where to investigate speakers' style management, its effective use, and how style reflects and transmits social meaning -which is both social and linguistic. The variability present within a given speech community is not just a matter of socio-demographic differences among speakers as reflected on their speech (inter-speaker variation), but also -and crucially-different speech styles based on situational contexts, audienceship and/or the image intended to project. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the main different theoretical approaches developed of stylistic variation in Sociolinguistics: Audio-monitorisation, Audience Design, Script Design, Functional Register and Speaker Design models. © 2018 Universidad de Murcia Servicio de Publicaciones.

The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of external factors like the diastratic, diastopic and diaphasic variations in the syllable duration in Euskera. To that end a corpus of 20,302 syllables have been analysed. This corpus is comprised by two text types ―one read and one spontaneous― produced by 100 speakers of the language, with Euskera as the mother tongue in some cases and Spanish and French in others and from all the territories of the Basque country. The results of different analysis can be classified into three groups: (1) there are statistically significant differences concerning genre and the mother tongue of the informants. (2) The type of text affects the syllable duration and it is statistically significant too, and (3) the geographical origin of the speakers affects the syllable duration. The continental Basque country is the place with the longest syllables. © Universitat de Barcelona

Research on nativelike variation in second language (L2) systems indicates that learners studying abroad may adapt to regional norms as they build sociolinguistic competence (e.g., Kanwit & Solon,; Salgado-Robles,). Spanish exhibits variation between the intensifiers muy [very] and bien [very] across numerous dialects. Recent research has shown greater preference for bien in Latin America than in Spain (Brown & Cortés-Torres,; Kanwit, Terán, & Pisabarro Sarrió,). Nevertheless, variable intensification in L2 Spanish remains uninvestigated. Data showed that learners studying in Mérida, Mexico, selected bien significantly more than did learners in Oviedo, Spain, at the conclusion of a 6-week stay abroad. This parallels the significantly higher selection on the same task by local Spaniards compared to local Mexican native speakers. Nonetheless, independent linguistic variables played a less straightforward role. © 2018 by American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages

In this article, we examine various strategies used to express cardinal numbers in Yucatec Maya Sign Languages (YMSLs) from three historically unrelated communities in Yucatán, Mexico: Chicán, Nohkop, and Cepeda Peraza. Our findings describe some numeral strategies, which remained unattested in previous accounts, and demonstrate that YMSL numerals exhibit patterns of systematic inter- and intracommunity variation as a result of linguistic and sociolinguistic factors. These patterns are still in process of becoming solidified and a high level of individual variation persists. The analysis of numerals in YMSLs provides us with an excellent opportunity to observe the emergence of sociolinguistic variation in young village sign languages. Our study is based on data from elicitation, natural conversations, and interviews, and takes into account several aspects: the influence of Yucatec Maya gestures on the formation of YMSL numeral signs, the regional and intracommunity distribution of numeral signs and numeral strategies, the impact of literacy on YMSL number expression, the existence of familylects and community members' language attitudes. Finally, we discuss some methodological challenges to studying variation in rural sign languages. © 2018 Gallaudet University Press. All Rights Reserved.

Säily (2016, Sociolinguistic variation in morphological productivity in eighteenth-century English. Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory 12(1). 129-151) offers a very interesting way of gauging the productivity of a word-formation pattern when the corresponding token counts vary. However, I disagree with the operationalization of productivity that she uses. If we employ vocabulary size as an indicator of productivity, later stages in a language's life will automatically be more productive. As an alternative, I suggest a neologism-based measure, which is preferable for various reasons. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

In this paper, I address sociolinguistic concerns related to the Judeo-Spanish language from prior to the expulsion of the Sephardic Jews from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1497) until the present day. After discussing relevant sociolinguistic models pre- and post-expulsion in order to account for variation across Judeo-Spanish speech communities worldwide, I discuss the current ethnolinguistic vitality of the language as well as the domains of use whereby speakers continue to utilize their heritage language. I then discuss sociolinguistic variation, noting variables that may condition elements of speech, supported by synchronic and diachronic studies related to the language. Given such factors, I examine two major contact situations: that of code-switching across communities as well as contact with non-Sephardic (“Modern”) varieties of Spanish. I conclude by offering ways in which students and scholars of the language can advance Judeo-Spanish sociolinguistics as a field, including a discussion of current research methodologies and other key considerations of the 21st century. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

In this study, I analyze the relationship between stance, style and sociolinguistic variation in a situation of language contact between Asturian and Spanish in the urban areas of Asturias (Spain). Using different types of data, and a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods, I explore the interactional functions of Asturian ‘ye’ (‘he/she/it is’), a salient marker of Asturian identity, and how the stances indexed by this form – low epistemic commitment, lack of seriousness and social solidarity – are connected to more enduring social identities. In the analysis, I provide a possible operationalization of stances that takes into consideration the multidimensionality of the stancetaking process. I also show how examining stance can provide a tool to move beyond monolithic representations of social meaning, and dichotomous distinctions between standard and non-standard variants. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study examines whether second-language instructors of Spanish overuse subject personal pronouns (SPPs) to facilitate communication with their English-speaking students, which would be a form of teacher talk. Ten native Spanish-speaking language instructors were recorded in two speech contexts: teaching a third-semester Spanish class to native English-speaking learners and talking with another native Spanish speaker. Logistic regression analyses using GoldVarb revealed that SPP expression was strongly conditioned both by the classroom as a speech context and by the linguistic factors including morphological ambiguity of the verb and switch reference. Crucially, instructors’ language in the classroom exhibited elevated and modified use of overt SPPs. This finding contributes to research on the variable use of Spanish SPPs, and it has important pedagogical implications for the acquisition of verbal morphology in the classroom context. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper explores Australian English (AuE), utilising a folk linguistic approach and engaging with its use in novel-writing. It is argued that discussions by contemporary Australian authors about their approaches to writing and voicing characters, and the actual voices authors give to their characters can be used as data to gain new understandings of what language forms have social meanings within AuE. The value of this analytical approach is then illustrated with interview and text extracts from one Australian author, revealing that this type of analysis provides insights into both the folk linguistic understandings of an author and how language variation is employed within the fiction series to index local types. It is concluded that such an approach can be generalised to better understand variation in AuE as accessed by other language-focussed professions and their differing conceptualisations of language, as well as to further understand variation in other varieties of English, and in other languages. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this paper. we offer a preliminary investigation of some aspects of individual and group variation in sign rate and rhythm, considering the sociolinguistic factors of Age (younger and older adults), Gender, and Sign Variety (Black and Mainstream American Sign Language). Differences in sign rate and rhythmic structure among signers were found in signers’ elicited narratives. A novel approach to phrasal rhythm is introduced, called “rhythm ratio”, which considers sign duration and transition duration together and is similar in spirit to the “normalized pairwise variability index” (nPVI) in spoken languages. This measure appears to be promising as a method for identifying rhythm class in sign languages; however, due to the small number of signers in each group these results can only be suggestive. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

The case at hand, which will be examined following the so-called comparative variationist method (cf.

We have come a long way in our understanding of language regard, yet there is still much to learn (e.g., Garrett 2010; McKenzie & Osthus 2011; Preston 2015). Why, for example, do some people delight in regional and social dialect differences while others become annoyed upon hearing the same linguistic features? Recent calls for more research on variation in language regard have identified an individual’s valuing of sociolinguistic diversity as especially worthy of more attention (Garrett 2010:176; Preston 2010:23). In response, we developed the first of our two research questions: How can we measure an individual’s valuing of sociolinguistic variation, what we call sociolinguistic receptivity (and further define in the next section)? Related to sociolinguistic receptivity is the positive or negative treatment of speakers who use nonstandard linguistic features. Attempts within linguistics to combat linguistic prejudice and discrimination and promote greater acceptability of a range of linguistic varieties and styles (and by extension speakers of those varieties and styles) typically rely on language awareness curricula that promote knowledge of linguistic and sociolinguistic principles or ideologies as the path to acceptance (Reaser 2006; Dunstan et al. 2015). The assumption underlying such attempts is that those who show greater knowledge and awareness of linguistic and sociolinguistic principles and openness to sociolinguistic variation will be more accepting of language variation, particularly nonstandard language varieties and by extension speakers of nonstandard varieties (e.g., Williams 1973:113; Reaser 2006). Our second research question attempts to test this common assumption: Is higher sociolinguistic receptivity associated with more positive ratings of informal and nonstandard linguistic features? In this chapter, we present a tool for assessing sociolinguistic receptivity and demonstrate that sociolinguistic receptivity is associated with acceptability of informal and nonstandard linguistic features. Our sociolinguistic receptivity tool is validated, in part, by the results of two different sample populations: One with training in linguistics and one without such training. Respondents with higher sociolinguistic receptivity scores rate sentences containing informal and nonstandard linguistic features as more correct than those with lower sociolinguistic receptivity scores. These results seem to provide the first empirical (quantitative) evidence linking favorable attitudes toward linguistic variation to greater acceptability of nonstandard, even stigmatized, linguistic features. © Cambridge University Press 2018.

The study of style within the variationist tradition of Sociolinguistics has been ancillary until very recently despite this centrality in sociolinguistic variation: it has been merely used as an independent variable (extralinguistic parameter) in the correlation of linguistic and extralinguistic variables, rather than as a sociolinguistic resource where to investigate speakers' style management, its effective use, and how style reflects and transmits social meaning -which is both social and linguistic. The variability present within a given speech community is not just a matter of socio-demographic differences among speakers as reflected on their speech (inter-speaker variation), but also -and crucially-different speech styles based on situational contexts, audienceship and/or the image intended to project. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the main different theoretical approaches developed of stylistic variation in Sociolinguistics: Audio-monitorisation, Audience Design, Script Design, Functional Register and Speaker Design models. © 2018 Universidad de Murcia Servicio de Publicaciones.

Various application fields of linguistics including automatic recognition and speech processing, teaching foreign languages and interpreting colloquial speech, characterization of sociolinguistic speech diversity, linguistic “portrayal” of a certain community (social dialect) and a particular persona (idiolect), linguistic examination (for example, for counter-terrorism efforts), among others, require not only extensive lexical and grammatical resources, but also the description of speech production mechanisms, mainly those, typical of spontaneous speech. Regrettably, the latter are almost always neglected by traditional dictionaries and grammar books, being out of scope of linguistic analysis. The knowledge of such mechanisms is necessary for colloquial studies (colloquialistics) per se, a branch of linguistics which studies everyday spoken language. The authors of this article make an attempt to systematize processes proceeding in modern colloquial language through the reliance on domestic and foreign professional academic literature and research results obtained from the ORD-corpus (everyday Russian spoken language) analysis. The research was fulfilled with the support of RFBR (Russian Foundation for Basic Research) No. 17-29-09175 “Diagnostic features of sociolinguistic variation in Russian everyday spoken language (evidence from a corpus)”. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

As numerous chapters in this volume explore, better understanding the perception of linguistic variation is crucial to a range of sociolinguistic enterprises, including the larger goal of uncovering the principles underlying sound change. In previous research comparing speakers’ vowel boundary categorization and vowel production, we have attempted to explore directly the underlying assumption of most sociolinguistic work of a linkage between how speech forms are produced and perceived by examining differences in vowel identification patterns across regional groups and individual talker-listeners. This work has suggested that regional differences in vowel production, such as that found for the mid-front vowels in the South and the North, correlates with significant differences in vowel perception (Fridland & Kendall 2012; Kendall & Fridland 2012). In the present project, we investigate how providing regionally contextualizing information about a speaker might affect how listeners perform on this same vowel identification task. While the perception study as originally designed provided no contextual or social information about the stimuli speaker, in the current study we administer the identical vowel identification study, only this time adding a talker description that explicitly locates the speaker’s hometown in the North, South, or West. Building on our earlier work exploring the relationship between production and perception, we examine here how the addition of this contextualization affected how listeners identified vowel categories in an attempt to understand how social stereotypes and local identity alter listeners’ identification of category boundaries. We undertake this work within the framework of both previous experimental phonetic research and sociolinguistically oriented work on perception. One of the major long-standing pursuits of sociolinguistics has been to understand the origins and spread of sound change. However, empirical research examining the role of perception in the actuation and dissemination of socially based language change has, for the most part, been neglected, though it is often assumed to be at the heart of transmission of such change (Labov 2001; Ohala 1981, 1989). While the exact nature of the role of speech perception in sound change may not be without debate (see Solé and Recasens (2012) for fuller treatment of this issue) the fact that speech perception is highly Germane to discussions of sociolinguistic variation in production should not be. © Cambridge University Press 2018.

Dialectal studies have traditionally divided Andalusia in three main areas based on the predominance of seseo, ceceo, or distinción. However, many speakers present a mix of the three phenomena in their speech, which has led to multiple opinions but has not been empirically studied yet. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate, by means of a quantitative sociolinguistic study, that the alternating use of seseo, ceceo, and distinción is no free but that it can ben explained by means of linguistic and social factors. The corpus consists of 36 semi-casual interviews with native speakers of Alcalá de Guadaíra (Seville). The results indicate that these Andalusian speakers present a mix of seseo, ceceo, and distinción, but all of them tend to favor distinción in formal contexts. Seseo and distinción were found to be more positively valued in this community than ceceo, as they are more common among young speakers with education, especially women, while ceceo is more characteristic of male speech and less education. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

This paper documents the linguistic landscape of Saint Catherine Street, a major thoroughfare in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The street is taken as a microcosm of the sociolinguistic variation observable at the various levels of analysis, ranging from the neighbourhood, the city, the province, Canada as a whole, and the globally similar environment of the downtown shopping street. By way of a systematic sampling of signs in the street's linguistic landscape, the interactions between federal policies of bilingualism, provincial laws strengthening the visibility of French, and local linguistic realities is considered, as is the impact of the global connectedness of both the ‘grassroots’ and the commercial world on the linguistic landscape in this street. While the presence of French and English is largely instrumental in function, many instances of other languages are found to be motivated by more symbolic functions, driven, in no small part, by the globally encoded indexical meanings of the languages in question. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group

Variable r-lessness in New Orleans English is a salient linguistic feature tied to local place-based identity. In this study, I examine rates of r-lessness in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which caused large-scale displacement in the region. Participants come from the linguistically conservative suburb of Chalmette, where r-lessness is more robust than in New Orleans proper. Participants’ connections to Chalmette were measured in two ways: (1) post-Katrina location status, i.e. whether participants returned or relocated after the storm; (2) place orientation, captured via an ethnographically informed, multifaceted measure of stance and exposure to places outside of Chalmette. Analysis revealed that place orientation better predicts rates of r-lessness than post-Katrina location. I argue that the marked quality of r-lessness makes it available for identity-driven use to express a connection to Chalmette. This study demonstrates one way to account for the linguistic implications of individuals’ shifting allegiances to places they live(d). © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The present contribution focuses on Benigni's auteur film La vita è bella (Italy, 1997) as a tool for the development of language competence in L2 English, Spanish and German, as well as of translation skills from Italian into these languages. The project, developed at the CLASS Language Centre at the University for Foreigners of Siena, Italy, is placed within the Centre's research activities on foreign language learning and audiovisual translation. More specifically, it addresses Italian-speaking students from the degree course in Linguistic and Cultural Mediation at advanced proficiency level in the three target languages. The study will examine the English, Spanish and German subtitles of the film (taken from the respective DVD versions), focusing on sequences which result in different translation outcomes in the three languages and specifically relate to the following aspects: culture-bound language, verbal and non-verbal humour, sociolinguistic variation and multilingualism (standard and regional Italian, German). Based mainly on Gottlieb's (1992) model of subtitling strategies, the research aims at promoting classroom reflection on translation creativity and potential inaccuracies in the reversed subtitles. The analysis ultimately suggests teaching activities which, moving from cross-linguistic comparison and the linguistic inventiveness that characterize the film, promote the development of students' metacompetences and integrated skills, as well as their critical abilities. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

This paper reports on patterns of sociolinguistic variation and change in Manchester's goose and goat vowels on the basis of the acoustic analysis of 122 speakers, stratified by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Goose fronting is an internal change showing little social differentiation, except before/l/as in school and pool, where, in contrast to most other dialects of English, goose shows advanced fronting inversely correlated with socioeconomic status. Goat fronting, on the other hand, is a change brought from outside the dialect by the highest status groups, displaying a pattern of monotonic social stratification, a female lead, and a strong effect of ethnicity. The role of attitudes toward the community in the realization of the vowels is compared with the effect of social class construed in terms of distances between social groups. Social class turns out to be a better predictor, suggesting that the role of attitudes and identity may be overestimated in research eschewing a systematic exploration of social class at the same time. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

An analysis of the non-deictic second person singular uses in Chilean Spanish is presented in this paper. The dataset is made of semi-spontaneous speech, specifically, sociolinguistic inter views, from which an exploratory corpus was extracted. In this context, the main goal of the research is to analyse the non-deictic 2nd person singular uses according to stylistic aspects through a new proposal of discourse-pragmatic categories which are related with linguistic and extralinguistic variables. Specifically, four categories are distinguished: a) generalization, b) focused generalization, c) inclusive defocalization and d) self-disguising. This classification is then correlated with the factors of forms of address and sex. Results regarding the sociolinguistic and morphosyntactic variables demonstrate that men present higher frequencies of use of the non-deictic strategies, specifically with voseo verb forms, while women tend to employ this device with tuteo. As for the categories, non-deictic usage is especially high through generalization and focused generalization, as strategies associated with a potential effect of empathy towards the interlocutor, especially in those cases where voseo is employed. In this sense, each of the categories proposed represents a specific discourse-pragmatic strategy at a stylistic variation level, which is regarded not only by the degree of formality, but also as a linguistic choice within the speakers' repertoire.

The Prize Paper Collections in the National Archives in Kew Gardens contain more than fifty-five Arabic letters and another two dozen accounts and other documents, which were seized in 1759 by British privateers as part of the loot on a Tuscan ship, set out from Livorno towards Alexandria. Virtually untouched since that time, they present a most exciting source of documentary Ottoman Arabic. The letters were written by Christian merchants trading in the Mediterranean and by Christian clergy in Rome to their co-religionists in Egypt and Turkey. This article presents an introduction to the Arabic Prize Papers, a short linguistic analysis of a preliminary corpus of eleven letters, the edition and translation of three sample letters. Particular attention is paid to the linguistic divergence between those letters written by merchants and those composed by church dignitaries, as well as to the sociolinguistic variation found in specific writers. © 2017 The author.

A sociolinguistic style consists of a set of linguistic resources that carry specific meaning within a social context (Campbell-Kibler 2011). One such resource is the use of phonetic variants that do not change the denotative meaning of a word, but are different enough to be recognized as unique. This type of socially constrained phonetic variation has frequently been dismissed as being outside the realm of phonology. In this study, I examine the feasibility of using social variation to inform phonological theory. I present a study of sociophonetic variation in men who identify as members of the Deaf and gay communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. I propose that a linguistic style employed by some Deaf gay men includes frequent use of distal joints in the articulation of signs. I show how analysis of this style can both enhance our understanding of the phonological structure of sign language and also demonstrate how models of phonology can accommodate sociolinguistic variation. By recasting social variation as a meaningful and informative aspect of phonology, we may better understand how we perceive, acquire, and use phonological structure.

This study aimed to advance research on first and second language future-time expression in Spanish and to demonstrate the strengths of combining functionalist, concept-oriented approaches (e.g., Andersen, 1984; Bardovi-Harlig, 2000; Shirai, 1995; von Stutterheim & Klein, 1987) with variationist approaches. The study targeted 140 participants (120 English-speaking learners of Spanish of varying proficiency and 20 native speakers of Spanish) who completed an oral task responding to eight prompts (e.g., describe tus planes para este fin de semana “describe your plans for this weekend”). Results from cross-tabulations and multinomial regressions indicated gradual inclusion of new linguistic and social variables as learner proficiency increased and demonstrated the value of considering both group and individual behavior. Findings were discussed in relation to stages of acquisition of future-time expression. © 2017 Language Learning Research Club, University of Michigan

Since the recent creation of a large-scale corpus of Italian Sign Language (LIS), a new research branch has been established to study the sociolinguistic variation characterizing this language in various linguistic domains. However, for nominal modification, the role of language-internal variation remains uncertain. This volume represents the first attempt to investigate sign order variability in this domain, examining what shapes the syntactic structure of LIS nominal expressions. In particular, three empirical studies are presented and discussed: the first two are corpus studies investigating the distribution and duration of nominal modifiers, while the third deals with the syntactic behavior of cardinal numerals, an unexplored area. In this enterprise, three different theoretical dimensions of inquiry are innovatively combined: linguistic typology, generative linguistics, and sociolinguistics. The research setup involves both quantitative and qualitative data. This mixed approach starts from corpus data to present the phenomenon, examine linguistic facts on a large scale, and draw questions from these, and then looks at elicited and judgment-based data to provide valid insights and refine the analysis. Crucially, the combination of different methods contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving nominal modification in LIS and its internal variation. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter Inc.

Languages exhibit sociolinguistic variation, such that adult native speakers condition the usage of linguistic variants on social context, gender, and ethnicity, among other cues. While the existence of this kind of socially conditioned variation is well-established, less is known about how it is acquired. Studies of naturalistic language use by children provide various examples where children's production of sociolinguistic variants appears to be conditioned on similar factors to adults’ production, but it is difficult to determine whether this reflects knowledge of sociolinguistic conditioning or systematic differences in the input to children from different social groups. Furthermore, artificial language learning experiments have shown that children have a tendency to eliminate variation, a process which could potentially work against their acquisition of sociolinguistic variation. The current study used a semi-artificial language learning paradigm to investigate learning of the sociolinguistic cue of speaker identity in 6-year-olds and adults. Participants were trained and tested on an artificial language where nouns were obligatorily followed by one of two meaningless particles and were produced by one of two speakers (one male, one female). Particle usage was conditioned deterministically on speaker identity (Experiment 1), probabilistically (Experiment 2), or not at all (Experiment 3). Participants were given tests of production and comprehension. In Experiments 1 and 2, both children and adults successfully acquired the speaker identity cue, although the effect was stronger for adults and in Experiment 1. In addition, in all three experiments, there was evidence of regularization in participants’ productions, although the type of regularization differed with age: children showed regularization by boosting the frequency of one particle at the expense of the other, while adults regularized by conditioning particle usage on lexical items. Overall, results demonstrate that children and adults are sensitive to speaker identity cues, an ability which is fundamental to tracking sociolinguistic variation, and that children's well-established tendency to regularize does not prevent them from learning sociolinguistically conditioned variation. © 2017 The Authors

In this paper I take a look at a classic problem in Spanish morphosyn-Tax, namely the alternation between the forms-se and-ra in the Imperfect Subjunctive (Imperfecto de Subjuntivo). Research on this topic has mainly focused on sociolinguistic variation, and has been done almost exclusively with impressionistic data and speakers' intuitions. I address the problem from a usage-based perspective, using corpus linguistics methods. The main claim is that the choice between-se and-ra correlates to a certain extent with morpho-syntactic and discourse factors. Through collostructional analysis I also show that there exists repelled and attracted collexemes that distinguish and relate both forms. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

This study compares the use of the variable (q), which is realized as rural [q] and urban, in the speech of twenty-Two parents and their twenty-one children from the village of Oyoun Al-Wadi in Syria. The study shows that children acquire the general gendered linguistic pattern of the community but do not replicate the linguistic frequencies that exist in their immediate environment. Boys and girls exhibit different linguistic behavior. Boys deviate from the non-local caregivers' proportions and approach men's local linguistic behavior, although their local variant proportions remain lower; girls, even those with local mothers, approach the women's supralocal variant proportions. The study shows that sociolinguistic variation is not acquired from adults from a very early age; it is acquired later in life after accepting and ascertaining the gendered linguistic differences and appropriateness norms. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

This article is a sociolinguistic study of the impact of four independent variables (age, sex, education and region of origin) on loanword pronunciation in Czech. The data were elicited in an empirical study carried out in 2014, in which 300 native speakers of Czech were recorded reading 300 loanwords in short sentences. Our focus in this article is on a sample of these loanwords that were identified to have two 'majority' pronunciation variants (i.e. variants for which 100 or more tokens were recorded) and we use sociolinguistic methods to uncover patterns of variation between different groups of speakers.

Advanced grammar courses often present standardized grammar rules to students without considering sociolinguistic variation. As a result, many native/heritage students feel that they speak “incorrectly,” and many second language learners do not get an accurate picture of the target language's real-world grammar. This article describes and evaluates a unique approach to teaching advanced Spanish grammar to university students. The curriculum focuses on core grammatical content by studying structures that are subject to sociolinguistic variation, as in había ∼ habían dos ranas [there was ∼ were two frogs], and it highlights the sociopolitical factors that explain why some forms are deemed prestigious. To test the efficacy of this curriculum, students enrolled in an advanced Spanish grammar course at a large university in the southwestern United States completed a pre- and posttest that measured Spanish grammar knowledge, awareness of sociolinguistic concepts, and positive language attitudes. Results showed statistically significant gains with respect to knowledge of grammar and sociolinguistics. Students also demonstrated a heightened awareness of how prejudice can manifest in judgments of spoken language. © 2017 by American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages

This paper brings together the study of sociolinguistic variation and the area of grammatical analysis by investigating demonstrative cleft constructions in spoken British English such as That's what I wanted to talk about and This is where I saw him. Using the Spoken BNC2014S, I ask whether speaker characteristics, including gender, age, education and occupation, might be correlated with the use of demonstrative clefts and with various aspects of their structure (preference for the distal or proximal demonstrative pronoun, use of negative polarity, and use of stance adverbs). Findings suggest that in British English, demonstrative cleft use is more likely to be present in the speech of male compared to female speakers, working adults in higher-skilled occupations compared to semi-skilled adults, and in adults of middle age compared to younger adults. This work shows that even highly abstract grammatical constructions can be sensitive to speaker preferences and linguistic communicative style. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

British Sign Language (BSL) is a visual-gestural language distinct from spoken languages used in the United Kingdom but in contact with them. One product of this contact is the use of fingerspelling to represent English words via their orthography. Fingerspelled loans can become “nativised”, adapting manual production to conform more closely to the native lexicon's inventory of phonemic constraints. Much of the previous literature on fingerspelling has focused on one-handed systems but, unlike the majority of sign languages, BSL uses a two-handed manual alphabet. What is the nature of nativisation in BSL, and does it exhibit sociolinguistic variation? We apply a cross-linguistic model of nativisation to BSL Corpus conversation and narrative data (http://bslcorpusproject.org) obtained from 150 signers in 6 UK regions. Mixed effects modelling is employed to determine the influence of social factors. Results show that the participants' home region is the most significant factor, with London and Birmingham signers significantly favouring use of fully nativised fingerspelled forms. Non-nativised sequences are significantly favoured in signers of increasing age in Glasgow and Belfast. Gender and parental language background are not found to be significant factors in nativisation. The findings also suggest a form of reduction specific to London and Birmingham. © 2017 Matt Brown, Kearsy Cormier, published by De Gruyter Open.

There is a long tradition of semantic studies regarding the concept of lexical meaning that refl ects the importance of sociocultural factors for its description. Some examples are the study of synonymy, some remarks in dictionaries and the typology of linguistic variation. This paper investigates lexical variants from a sociolinguistic point of view in socially stratifi ed samples. The statistical analysis of the data obtained up to now confi rms the relevance of sociolinguistic variables such as the degree of (in) formality, the hearer, the topic of the conversation, the situation where communication takes place, and options offered by the lexicon.

The study of attenuation has experienced a considerable but still limited development in the last decades. It has been tackled, especially, within the disciplines that work with the spoken language, such as pragmatics or discourse analysis, which have broadened the scope of study. So far, one of the least addressed issues in the use of attenuation strategies in Spanish is the variation conditioned by social factors. Hence, with the final aim of gaining deeper knowledge about the use Spanish speakers make of attenuation devices, the discursive functions these fulfill and the incidence that given social factors (e.g. gender, age and level of instruction) have on their use, solid socio pragmatic research is being carried out within the framework of the research project entitled "Socio-linguist Study on the Spanish from Spain and Latin America Project (PRESEEA)". In this article the more significant results obtained after the analysis of the Madrid corpus and the more relevant conclusions reached are presented.

Language and Social Change in China: Undoing Commonness through Cosmopolitan Mandarin offers an innovative and authoritative account of the crucial role of language in shaping the sociocultural landscape of contemporary China. Based on a wide range of data collected since the 1990s and grounded in quantitative and discourse analyses of sociolinguistic variation, Qing Zhang tracks the emergence of what she terms “Cosmopolitan Mandarin” as a new stylistic resource for a rising urban elite and a new middle-class consumption-based lifestyle. The book powerfully illuminates that Cosmopolitan Mandarin participates in dismantling the pre-reform, socialist, conformist society by bringing about new social distinctions. Rich in cultural and linguistic details, the book is the first of its kind to highlight the implications of language change on the social order and cultural life of contemporary China. Language and Social Change in China is ideal for students and scholars interested in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology, and Chinese language and society. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Based on a critical reading of Chapters 2-10, this postscript discusses the present book’s contribution to the emerging framework of sociolinguistic change, which addresses a range of sociolinguistic processes beyond feature-based linguistic change. In a sociolinguistic change framework, media are theorized as spaces of sociolinguistic variation and change in their own right, and media language practices are examined in terms of their relations to non-mediatized language. These include the role of media representations in the enregisterment of speech forms, the uptake and recontextualization of media language fragments, and the circulation of linguistic innovations across modes of mediated communication and user networks. Research on sociolinguistic change offers new perspectives on the interaction between genre, style, and change, for example with regard to the impact of genre change on linguistic change, the role of highly visible media speakers, and the way media performance may reinforce enregisterment. © Oxford University Press 2017.

Political surveys have indicated a relationship between a sense of Scottish identity and voting decisions in the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum. Identity is often reflected in language use, suggesting the intuitive hypothesis that individuals who support Scottish independence are more likely to use distinctively Scottish words than those who oppose it. In the first large-scale study of sociolinguistic variation on social media in the UK, we identify distinctively Scottish terms in a data-driven way, and find that these terms are indeed used at a higher rate by users of pro-independence hashtags than by users of anti-independence hashtags. However, we also find that in general people are less likely to use distinctively Scottish words in tweets with referendum-related hashtags than in their general Twitter activity. We attribute this difference to style-shifting relative to audience, aligning with previous work showing that Twitter users tend to use fewer local variants when addressing a broader audience. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.

The presented research was carried out on the material of the ORD speech corpus in the framework of the project, dedicated to study sociolinguistic variation of Russian speech and aimed at identifying diagnostic features characterizing everyday speech of major social groups (age-, gender-, status-, professional-related, etc.). The obtained results showed that practically on each linguistic level one may observe the features exhibiting a very high similarity between different sociolects. In particular, the coincidence is observed in the distribution of phonemes, distribution of parts of speech, and the frequency of some syntactic structures. The distribution of phonemes was determined on the sUBcorpus of 172,000 allophones. The following ten phonemes are the most frequent in speech of all social groups: /a/ (18,18%), /i/ (9,04%), /t/ (6,36%), /o/ (5,43%), /u/ (4,49%), /n/ (4,11%), /j/ (3,82%), /e/ (3,57%), /k/ (3,35%), /s/ (3.01%). The distribution of parts of speech in everyday speech was obtained on the linguistically annotated sUBcorpus of 125,437 tokens and has the following breakdown: V (17,43%), S (15,29%), S-PRO (14,13%), PART (13,35%), CONJ (9,47%), PR (7,09%), ADV-PRO (5,30 %), ADV (4,51%), A-PRO (4,30%), A (3,73%), PRAEDIC (1,84%), INTJ (1,41%), NUM (1,29%), PARENTH (0,56 %), ANUM (0,27%), PRAEDIC-PRO (0,01%). At the syntactic level, one-element structures are prevailing in everyday speech of all social groups, the most frequent among them being D (particle / discursive word) (3,73%), S (2,26%), and V (1,88%). Statistical analysis of the left-branching and right-branching verb groups has showed that the first ones significantly prevail in speech of all sociolects. The revealed features reflect some constant, universal properties of everyday spoken Russian and can be used for adjustment and improvement of speech synthesis and recognition systems.

As Eckert (2011) remarks, these are indeed exciting times for the study of sociolinguistic variation and that excitement is enhanced by the prospect of more wide-ranging explanations through the pursuit of interdisciplinary projects. Such inter disciplinarity entails both collaboration with social scientists, such as socio logists and anthropologists and, ideally, a coming together with linguists schooled in other (usually more formal) approaches but who are now showing con si derable interest in variation. With regard to the first of these two pathways, this volume contains two contributions on the macro-sociological dimension of socio-economic categorizations (Harrison and Lambert), which are at the core of a Labov ian approach. Since the early survey studies such as Labov (1966) and Trudgill (1974), which charted the territory of correlations between linguistic variability and the major demographic categories, social structure in western societies has changed in far-reaching and largely convergent ways. Some of the most important changes are the consequences of de-industrialization and the growing significance of the services sector in the economy in terms of the proportion of the workforce it occupies. One of the consequences of what has become the dominance of the services sector is the moyennisation of society, namely, the emergence of a numerically significant phalanx of people in the ‘middle of the social pile’ (the median classes). This shift away from the industrial sector in western countries has been partly driven by globalization which gives rise to conditions favouring the emergence of a new elite (although, as Bourdieu 1984 [1979] has argued, more traditional elites have found ways of perpetuating privilege) and, despite abundant fashionable discourses of equality, inequalities, as Pfefferkorn’s and Tissot’s contributions demonstrate, persist, resulting since the oil crisis of the 1970s in stubbornly high levels of unemployment as well as low-wage and insecure employment that correspond to the lot of a growing ‘underclass’ (groupe d’exclusion in Chauvel’s (2005) terms, see Table 1). Such social categorizations are, as these authors underscore, not neutral but ideologically loaded and capable of being infused with positive or pejorative connotations. Scholars in the English-speaking world now regard the correlation of such macro-sociological categories and linguistic behaviour as the first wave of variationist studies,1 the necessary broad initial charting of previously uncharted waters, but which now need to be refined by approaches which explain why speakers with similar broad social characteristics may behave differently or indeed why speakers with contrasting social profiles can behave similarly. If, as Coulangeon’s study of patterns of cultural consumption suggests, individuals of all social backgrounds are working out their identity within shared (but differentiated) cultural spaces, differentiation in language behaviour may well manifest comparable patterns, as Armstrong and Pooley (2010) argue, with regard to what they termed the zeitgeist, or spirit of the times. Perhaps more problematic than collaboration with sociologists and anthropologists is working with linguists with backgrounds in formal linguistics. Durand and his co-workers of course straddle imperiously the terrains of theoretical phonology and sociolinguistics, establishing as normal practice the use of instrumental techniques to reveal variation of great subtlety and key interest to both phonologists and sociolinguists, although, as Boughton’s contribution reminds us, such differences may also be uncovered by auditory means. Bulot’s contribution confirms the interconnectivity of dialectology and sociolinguistics, taken as given in the English-speaking world (see, for example, Chambers & Trudgill 1998), but historically largely developing along separate lines among francophone scholars. The recognition since 2001 of what were traditionally regarded as dialects as langues de France means that an Oïl language such as Gallo may be perceived as raising comparable issues in terms of survival and the struggle for social space to Breton (Bulot, this volume) and Provençal (Costa 2011). Both Breton and Provençal may be said to have become urbanized and gentrified, to a greater or lesser degree, as may be the urban spaces formerly associated with the industrial working classes (Trimaille & Gasquet-Cyrus, this volume). The high degree of phonological levelling in French in France in particular (Armstrong & Pooley 2010) leads Armstrong to address the question of whether variation has shifted from phonology to grammar (an issue addressed also by Coveney, this volume) and lexis. Armstrong, as Coveney (2011) and Gadet (Gadet & Tyne 2012) have done elsewhere, tackles the question of whether the situation of French may be construed as diglossic. The interdisciplinary ramifications are considerable since, on the one hand, formal linguists (e.g. Rowlett 2007, Massot 2008, 2010, Zribi-Hertz 2011) have been drawn to the analysis of variation, and on the other, educational issues related to the teaching of standard French in the education system are more than touched upon. Gadet’s central role in the Multicultural Paris French Project points to something of a departure from the (albeit ethnographically sound) variationist approach adopted by the already completed Multicultural London English Project, incorporating approaches characteristic of what Eckert (2011) calls the third wave of variationist studies (see also note 1 below), which seeks to elucidate how individuals construct meaning in interaction taking into account as many elements of the social environment as possible. © Modern Humanities Research Association and Taylor and Francis 2013.

It is a long time since dialectal researches have taken a new course, focused on urban spoken varieties more than on rural varieties. Moreover, they focus on the interaction between independent variables and linguistic variables. Nevertheless, this is not the case of the Basque language, as there have been few researches from this point of view. The aim of this contribution is to show that Basque is not an isolated case; as a living language it has changed through time and it is, indeed, changing nowadays. The focus of the research is the variant of the basque spoken in Gernika, and it is based in 5 linguistic variables which present a sociolinguistic variation of palatalization: variable (is), variable (it), variable (il), variables (ind) and (ild) and variable (iv). The realizations of these variables have been studied taking into account some independent variables such as age, genre, parent's origin and school.

Bermudian English (BE) is of interest due to its distinctiveness from most varieties of British and American English, but to date, few studies have examined the variety, with the last phonological description of BE published by Ayers in 1933. This paper provides an initial description of the vowel systems of young, black, Bermudian English speakers, especially as compared to the systems of speakers of Mainstream U.S. English (MUSE). The study was conducted with five native Bermudian speakers who participated in a word list task and a picture task to elicit naturalistic speech. Results of analyses of vowel plots comparing formant values of Bermudian speakers with formant values of Mainstream U.S. English speakers from Hillenbrand et al. (1995), indicate that Bermudian speakers differ from MUSE speakers in several striking ways. For instance, [a] and [] are backer and higher for these BE speakers than for the MUSE speakers. Also, [o], [u], and [] are substantially more fronted in BE. Results of regression models also show that these Bermudian speakers have a near complete merger of // and /ae/, and prerhotic centralization and merger of /i/ and //. These findings provide directions for future phonetic and sociolinguistic descriptions and analysis of Bermudian English. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.

Archival oral histories provide sociolinguists with invaluable empirical insight, particularly with respect to studying vernaculars of the past. Because the goal of the oral history methodology is to capture authentic, first-person accounts, the recordings are comparable to sociolinguistic interviews. In this audio feature, the Farm Work and Farm Life Since 1890 Oral History project, which contains interviews with elderly farmers in Ontario, Canada, born between 1890 and 1920, is used to exemplify the utility of oral histories, particularly for variationist sociolinguists. The audio feature first demonstrates the parallels between sociolinguistic interviews and oral histories: both exhibit Labovian "casual speech" and high-emotive topics, both diminish the role of the interviewer, and, perhaps most importantly for variationist sociolinguists, both contain sociolinguistic variation. The remainder of the audio feature highlights some of this variation, including negative concord, was/were variation, and discourse like, and closes with a discussion of two revelations about the sociohistorical and sociolinguistic nature of the speech communities examined.

This book investigates the acquisition of sociolinguistic knowledge in the early elementary school years of a Mandarin-English two-way immersion program in the United States. Using ethnographic observation and quantitative analysis of data, the author explores how input from teachers and classmates shapes students' language acquisition. The book considers the different sociolinguistic messages conveyed by teachers in their patterns of language use and the variety of dialects negotiated and represented. Using analysis of teacher speech, corrective feedback and student language use, the author brings together three analyses to form a more complete picture of how children respond to sociolinguistic variation within a two-way immersion program. © 2017 Rebecca Lurie Starr.

This paper attempts to give an account of grammatical & sociolinguistic variation in Hindi, which is used as contact language across the states of Bihar and Jharkhand in India. The nature of the study is socio/ethno-linguistic in a contact setting that is why lots of time was spent in these states and data was collected from the speakers face-to-face. In this paper I attempt to wed the fields of contact linguistics and sociolinguistics and draw inferences from the sociolinguistic variation in language regarding the direction of contact, attitude of speakers towards the languages in contact and the type of contact taking place in the said case and whether or not it is a case of a non-dominant variety and pluricentricity. © 2016 Peter Lang GmbH.

Intraspeaker sociolinguistic variation is typically characterized by repetitiveness in what choices speakers make from moment to moment, but there are multiple possible sources of such repetitiveness. We distinguish two types of temporal clustering: sequential dependence and baseline deflection. We argue that because we have independent reasons from sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics to believe both types are at play in speech production, it is desirable to adopt quantitative models that can simultaneously estimate these distinct sources of temporal clustering. We propose the use of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) for this purpose and illustrate with a case study of DH-stopping in Philadelphia English sociolinguistic interviews. We advocate for the adoption of GAMMs to advance the use of naturalistic data for studying psycholinguistic questions about intraspeaker variation. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Previous studies of language contact in multilingual urban neighborhoods in Europe claim the emergence of new varieties spoken by immigrant-background youth. This paper examines the sociolinguistic conditioning of variation in allophones of Swedish of young people of immigrant and nonimmigrant background in Stockholm and Gothenburg. Although speaker background and sex condition the variation, their effects differ in each city. In Stockholm there are no significant social differences and the allophonic difference appears to have been neutralized. Gothenburg speakers are divided into three groups, based on speaker origin and sex, each of which orients toward different norms. Our conclusions appeal to dialectal diffusion and the desire to mark ethnic identity in a diverse sociolinguistic context. These results demonstrate that not only language contact but also dialect change should be considered together when investigating language variation in modern-day cities. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

Post-colonial interactions between indigenous groups in Amazonia have intrigued observers since contact was established between non-indigenous Brazilians and first-nation peoples. Exchanges between different ethnic groups were largely referred to en passant or in an anecdotal manner. Yet an expanding literature dealing with the dynamics of interethnic contact can now help assess the historical precedents and sociolinguistic features between different indigenous communities. In this article we explore the contact history of the Awá-Guajá of eastern Amazonia, and the sociolinguistic variation that developed between their different communities and neighboring indigenous groups. The Awá-Guajá came into permanent contact with Brazilian mainstream society in 1973 and were settled into four communities by Brazil's Indian Service. They are Tupí-Guaraní speakers and can converse with other members of this language family, namely, the Ka'apor and Tenetehara. This interaction reveals linguistic affinities and a distinct historical engagement between these groups. Loan words and dialects developed from these relationships, and each group was also influenced by the enveloping machinations of mainstream society. The Awá-Guajá defer to the Ka'apor and Tenetehara yet keep a guarded distance from them, exposing an interesting dynamic that remits us to power relations, historical ecology, and the looming influence of the Brazilian state. © 2016 by De Gruyter Mouton.

Sociolinguistic Styles presents a new and in-depth, historically rooted overview of the phenomenon of style-shifting in sociolinguistic variation. Written by an internationally acclaimed expert in the field, the text explores why, where and when it occurs. Full examination of the complex phenomenon of style-shifting in sociolinguistics, focusing on its nature and social motivations, as well as on the mechanisms for its usage and its effects. In-depth, up-to-date critical overview of the different theoretical approaches accounting for stylistic variation, exploring their historical roots not only in sociolinguistics and stylistics or semiotics but also in classical fields such as rhetoric and oratory. Coverage of a wide range of related concepts and issues, from the oldest Greek ethos and pathos or Roman elocutio and pronuntiatio to the contemporary enregisterment, stylisation, stance, or crossing.

This paper presents ongoing work on Säily and Suomela's (2009) method of comparing type frequencies across subcorpora. The method is here used to study variation in the productivity of the suffixes -ness and -ity in the eighteenth-century sections of the Corpora of Early English Correspondence and of the Old Bailey Corpus (OBC). Unlike the OBC, the eighteenth-century section of the letter corpora differs from previously studied materials in that there is no significant gender difference in the productivity of -ity. The study raises methodological issues involving periodization, multiple hypothesis testing, and the need for an interactive tool. Several improvements have been implemented in a new version of our software. © 2016 by De Gruyter Mouton 2016.

This chapter aims to treat the more significant variable phonological processes of Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European Portuguese (EP). It first discusses the variation in the vocalic sounds, for both varieties, after which it turns to the consonantal variation. Both EP and BP realize a symmetrical seven-vowel system under stress:/i, e, e, a, u, o, o/. In EP, [B] is the typical unstressed allophone of/a/. The northern dialects merge the present and past forms, which all show stressed [B], whereas the central-southern dialects still maintain the contrast. The system of consonantal phonemes is identical for EP and BP. Through the influence of the high vowel [i] or the glide [y], the coronal stops/t, d/are affricated in BP, becoming [tj] and [dj]. The BP coda can only be filled by one of the consonants/l, R, S, N/. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.

To account for the full range of language use in contemporary multilingual urban contexts, the notion of target language (TL) needs to be reconsidered. In studies of second language acquisition and language variation, taking TL for granted implies that people agree on what constitutes ‘good’ language, or the standard norm. The TL of language learners and users is, however, more heterogeneous than is often assumed. To gain insight into what people are actually targeting in their language development and use, we need to study their perceptions of ambient sociolinguistic variation. In this folk linguistic listener study involving 343 upper secondary school students, a range of data types were analysed: attitude scales, variety labelling, and assessments of speakers’ social and linguistic backgrounds. This article highlights some results pointing to a considerable divergence in the listeners’ perceptions, in particular with regard to speech representing what is here characterised as migration-related social dialects. Several listeners labelled these samples as ‘good’ Swedish, possibly suggesting that they do not simply aim at or even relate to a TL identical with the dominating monolingual norm, but may instead have a less narrow view of the kind of Swedish they consider appropriate for use in more formal situations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

This article analyzes the distribution ofthe discourse marker ahora sí (que) in two varieties of Mexican Spanish, Mexico City and Monterrey, and at two different time periods. Making use ofthe PRESEEA corpora from both cities and another two corpora ofsociolinguistic interviews collected several decades ago, the study finds clear diachronic and geographic differences: the discourse marker is more frequent in Mexico City than in Monterrey and, in both varieties, it is more frequent in the more recent corpora. Moreover, the frequency analysis ofthe discourse marker shows interesting social differences in the use ofahora sí (que) in Mexico City, where it is favored by young speakers, men and speakers oflow and medium instruction.

The research presented in this paper has been conducted in the framework of the large sociolinguistic project aimed at describing everyday spoken Russian and analyzing the special characteristics of its usage by different social groups of speakers. The research is based on the material of the ORD corpus containing long-term audio recordings of everyday communication. The aim of the given exploratory study is to reveal the linguistic parameters, in terms of which the difference in speech between different social groups is the most evident. An exploratory subcorpus, consisting of audio fragments of spoken communication of 12 respondents (6 men and 6 women, 4 representatives for each age group, and representatives of different professional and status groups) with the total duration of 106 min and of similar communication settings, was created and fully annotated. The quantitative description of a number of linguistic parameters on phonetic, lexical, morphological, and syntax levels in each social group was made. The biggest difference between social groups was observed in speech rate, phonetic reduction, lexical preferences, and syntactic irregularities. The study has shown that the differences between age groups are more significant than between gender groups, and the speech of young people differs most strongly from the others. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

This paper examines coronal stop deletion (CSD), the deletion of word-final /-t, -d/ in consonant clusters, in three new varieties of Asian English: China English, Hong Kong English, and Viet Nam English. The study seeks to determine to which extent the linguistic and extralinguistic constraints found to govern CSD in other varieties of English also impact CSD in emerging Englishes such as those examined in the current study. A total of 60 tertiary students, 20 from each variety of English, participated in the study. Results indicate that, while new Englishes such as China English, Hong Kong English, and Viet Nam English are affected by constraints such as linguistic environment and morphological conditioning, the proficiency level of speakers impacts CSD rates and the effects of the various constraints. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

A contact setting often limits speakers’ possibilities to practice the minority language in an array of contexts and thus affects its stylistic and sociolinguistic variation. This paper examines rhythmic variation in read and spontaneous speech samples from speakers of minority Ontario French (Canada). Rate, nPVI-V, VarcoV, %V and the CC model are used to examine the extent of sociolinguistic variation in the dataset and test the hypotheses of convergence to English and of sociolinguistic discontinuity. Age, gender and speaking style each appear to be significant factors, without showing interaction. Females and older speakers showed a more syllable-timed pattern than males and younger participants. In spontaneous speech, all speakers had a less syllable-timed rhythmicity, despite a faster rate. Overall, speakers did not converge to English. © 2016, International Speech Communications Association. All rights reserved.

Several studies have demonstrated that the analysis of features that show sociolinguistic variation provides important information about speakers and, therefore, they are useful to be considered in forensic contexts (Moosmüller 1997; Loakes and McDougall 2004, 2007, 2010; de Jong et al 2007a and 2007b). The present research analyses the discriminatory potential of three allophonic processes of /t/ that show variation in Standard Southern British English (SSBE): tapping, glottaling and frication. Nine categorical variables that consider these processes were formulated and compared by means of the Chi-square test in a corpus containing real-time data from 10 different speakers (five males and five females). Results show that these processes are speaker and context specific since they exhibit high discriminatory potential only in certain linguistic contexts, where intra-speaker variation is low and inter-speaker variation is high. Therefore, the study presented here highlights the relevance of the analysis of sociolinguistic variation in forensic contexts. © 2016, EQUINOX PUBLISHING.

One of the deepest differences between English-based human interaction and the interaction based on the languages of continental Europe has to do with terms of address. For speakers of languages like French, Italian, or German it goes without saying that “polite” words such as vous, Lei and Sie are indispensable in daily exchanges with others. What do these words actually mean? To what extent do their meanings differ from one European language to another? Why can some of these terms, for example, vous, be applied to God (or to one’s spouse), whereas others, for example, Sie, cannot? There has been an upsurge of interest in both nominal and pronominal terms of address in recent years, but most publications in this area focus on frequencies, forms, functions, and sociolinguistic variation, with virtually no mention of meaning. To uncover the secrets hidden in the meanings of such essential tools of daily communication remain invisible and to bring to light their cultural significance, we need an appropriate methodology. As I hope to show in the present paper, NSM (Natural Semantic Metalanguage) semantics provides the necessary tools and techniques. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

The ORD corpus is one of the largest resources of contemporary spoken Russian. By 2014, its collection numbered about 400 h of recordings made by a group of 40 respondents (20 men and 20 women, of different ages and professions), who volunteered to spend a whole day with a switched-on voice recorder, recording all their verbal communication. The corpus presents the unique linguistic material recorded in natural communicative situations, allowing spoken Russian and the everyday discourse to be studied in many aspects. However, the original sample of respondents was not sufficient enough to study a sociolinguistic variation of speech. Thus, it was decided to launch a large project aiming at the ORD sociolinguistic extension, which was supported by the Russian Science Foundation. The paper describes the general principles for the sociolinguistic extension of the corpus. It defines social groups which should be presented in the corpus in adequate numbers, sets criteria for selecting participants, describes the “recorder’s kit” for the respondents and involves the adaptation principles of the ORD annotation and structure. Now, the ORD collection exceeds 1200 h of recordings, presenting speech of 127 respondents and hundreds of their interlocutors. 2450 macro episodes of everyday spoken communication have been already annotated, and the speech transcripts add up to 1 mln words. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

A Framework for Cognitive Sociolinguistics attempts to lay out the epistemological system for a cognitive sociolinguistics-the first book to do so in the English language. The intention of this volume is not to provide a simple catalog of sociolinguistic principles or of theoretical postulates of a cognitive nature, but rather it aims to build a verifiable metatheoretical basis for cognitive sociolinguistics. This book is articulated through a series of propositions, accompanied by annotations and commentaries that develop, qualify and exemplify these propositions. As for the research questions that would be central to a cognitive sociolinguistic endeavor, the following incomplete catalog could be enumerated: What do speakers know about their language? What do they know about communicative interaction? What do speakers know about sociolinguistic variation? Where does that knowledge reside and how is it configured? How does social reality influence the origin and processing of language? How does language use affect the configuration, evolution and variation of language? What do speakers know about their socio-communicative context? How do speakers perceive sociolinguistic reality? What are speakers’ attitudes and beliefs regarding linguistic variation? How does sociolinguistic perception influence speakers’ communicative behavior at all levels? How does language contribute to the construction of identity? Offering a fresh perspective on the frequently taught and studied topic of cognitive linguistics, A Framework for Cognitive Sociolinguistics can easily be incorporated into existing courses in the areas of both cognitive and sociocultural linguistics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

In this paper, the authors analyze Croatian invariant relativizers (InvRels) in European perspective, with emphasis on InvRels employed in non-standard Croatian. The paper is roughly divided in two parts. In the first part of the pa per, previously researched facts about InvRels are reviewed. It is demonstrated that in Croatian, InvRels are more typical of non-standard variety and with fewer syntactic restrictions when compared to standard Croatian. Sociolinguistic variation is also briefly commented on. In the second part of the paper, two previously unanalyzed features of non-standard InvRels are examined by means of the hrWac 2.0 corpus: distribution across the position relativized, and the use of resumptive pronouns with direct object. Due to the nature of corpus data, the investigation was narrowed to the InvRels šta and kaj. The paper demonstrates that the two InvRels are found in most cases with subject, and to a lesser extent with direct object relativization. Other positions relativized are rarely encountered. Resumptive pronouns with inanimate direct objects are readily omitted, while with animate direct object the omission seems fairly rare. These findings are important because they display that only subject and direct object are regularly relativized, even in non-standard Croatian. Furthermore, the major role of animacy with respect to the use of resumptive pronouns is pointed out, with a comparable tendency in Czech (Fried 2010). © 2016, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University.

Introduction Two trends have characterised the study of language variation and change in the last few decades: (i) an increased interest in discourse-pragmatic features, i.e., features such as discourse markers, hedges, interjections, response signals etc. whose primary functions are attitudinal, interactional and textual; and (ii) a growing number of studies that use spoken corpora, i.e., large bodies of transcribed speech stored as computer files, as the basis for describing various aspects of socially significant discourse-pragmatic variation (see, for example, Andersen 2001; Buchstaller and van Alphen 2012; Cheshire et al. 2008; Pichler 2013; Tagliamonte and Denis 2010; Torgersen et al. 2011; Tottie 2011; see further Andersen 2010b; Baker 2010 for overviews). Corpora have been used to study patterns of sociolinguistic variation within a single corpus as well as across multiple corpora representing different regional varieties or different points in time. Investigations of comparable corpora which are collected at different times and which together span a shorter period of time than is usual for historical linguistics have come to be termed ‘short-term diachronic comparable corpus linguistics’ (Leech et al. 2009: 24). This is the approach which will be taken in the current chapter. In this chapter, I draw attention to two different but nevertheless coherent and complementary ways of using corpora for the study of language variation and change: the corpus-based and the corpus-driven methods (Biber 2009a; Tognini-Bonelli 2001). In corpus-based studies, researchers have an a priori assumption of a particular word form or set of forms which are known to or likely to be found in a corpus. This assumption is usually based on preliminary observations of the data or hypotheses about a form’s occurrence in a particular language variety. Researchers use the corpus to search for this form and to analyse its use and distribution in the corpus (see, for example, Andersen 2001; Torgersen et al. 2011). Corpus-driven research, by contrast, is a more inductive and exploratory approach that makes no or minimal assumptions as to which word forms and categories a corpus contains and therefore ‘differs from the standard practice of linguistics’ (Biber 2009a: 276). It generally involves calculating frequencies of individual word forms and sequences of words within and across different corpora, thus inductively ‘exploiting the potential of a corpus to identify linguistic categories and units that have not been previously recognised’ (Biber 2009a: 278). © Cambridge University Press 2016.

Natural human languages often contain variation (sociolinguistic or Labovian variation) that is passed from one generation of speakers to the next, but studies of acquisition have largely ignored this, instead focusing on aspects of language that are more deterministic. Theories of acquisition, however, must be able to account for both. This article examines variation from the perspective of the statistical learning framework and explores features of variation that contribute to learnability. In particular, it explores whether conditioning variables (i.e. where the pattern of variation is slightly different in different contexts) lead to better learning of variation as compared to when there are no conditioning variables, despite the former being conceptually more difficult. Data from two experiments show that adult learners are fairly good at learning patterns of both conditioned and unconditioned variation, the latter result replicating earlier studies. Five-to-seven-yearold children, in contrast, had different learning outcomes for conditioned versus unconditioned variation, with fewer children regularizing or imposing deterministic patterns on the conditioned variation. However, the children who did not impose deterministic patterns did not necessarily acquire the variation patterns the adults did. © 2015.

This article is concerned with the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation, which is central to native speaker competence. It explores the acquisition of variable quotative marking within the local Learner English ecology in a cohort of German students. The data consist of 809 instances of quotation produced by 45 speakers, all of whom are currently completing their bachelor's and master's degrees and who have different exposure types to English spoken in a naturalistic context. The authors focus on the acquisition of the constraints that govern the variable use of the innovative quotative form be like, which is not formally taught in classes of English as a foreign language. The data suggest that German learners of English with an extensive record of face-to-face communications with native speakers are rather adept at picking up on the grammar that governs the quotative system and innovative be like more specifically. Overall, the study contributes to the discussion of what is possible in the second-language acquisition of the variable grammar, while exploring the sociolinguistic and cognitive mechanisms that shape the formation of nonnative Englishes worldwide.

There is a widely held belief that Hong Kong as a community is suffering from an ongoing decline in its standard of English. A very cursory search in the Internet directs readers to many articles lamenting the purportedly poor English standard of Hong Kong people. Appeals for Hong Kongers to improve their English are easy to find. These often originate out of concerns over the unwelcoming possibility of losing out to their close economic competitors such as Singaporeans and their compatriots from China, owing to the importance of English in international trade and communication. However, through reviewing publicly available data, this article reveals that the critique directed at Hong Kong people’s English standard does not always hold up against scrutiny. This article aims to demythologise the issue and points readers’ attention to the possibility of the emergence of a new standard which helps perform important sociolinguistic functions in Hong Kong society. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Ethnicity has long been known to affect language variation. However, existing studies have overwhelmingly focused on the speech of the largest, non-White minority groups and have rarely investigated within-group variation. In this paper, I review sociolinguistic studies of a White minority group in two different settings and argue that the study of sociolinguistic variation across and within minority groups can help disentangle and systematize the effect of ethnicity on language. I focus on reports of linguistic variation for Polish immigrants in the United States (a case of sustained, long-term immigration) and in the United Kingdom (a case of recent migration with indefinite plans for long-term residence). Through these two case studies, I illustrate that a strong Polish identity affects speakers' adoption of regional variation in English. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In a world where most individuals speak more than one language and most languages are in contact with other languages, the study of language in its social context must take into account language contact. Two central questions in the study of language contact and change are (1) whether social or linguistic factors are primary in predicting the outcomes of contact; and (2) whether change in the context of contact is a foregone conclusion. Quantitative studies of sociolinguistic variation provide an effective means of observing change in progress, but the majority of such studies have focused on monolingual speakers/communities. This article gives a brief summary of the study of language contact in variationist sociolinguistics before turning to a discussion of the types of data and approaches best suited to answering the question of how and when contact causes change in multilingual communities. Recognizing that the description of a multilingual community involves more social parameters and more inter-individual variation than a monolingual one, this article focuses on a core list of social factors to consider in studies of variation and change in multilingual communities, organized so that possible intersections may also be considered. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigated the acquisition of an Egyptian phonological variant by student participants in a study abroad program at The American University in Cairo. Participants completed pre- and post-study abroad Simulated Oral Proficiency Interviews (SOPIs). The SOPI data showed a move toward an Egyptian realization of the phonological variable on the part of most participants. Furthermore, extralinguistic factors such as participant gender and status as a heritage speaker were likewise shown to influence variant choice, while factors such as length of stay abroad and word position of the target token were not shown to have a significant effect on target item realization. In contrast to other studies investigating the acquisition of target language sociolinguistic norms in the form of phonological variables in Spanish, this study found an extremely high rate of learner adoption of an Egyptian realization of this variable among learners of Arabic in Cairo. © 2015 by American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.

This paper presents a state of the Arts of religious/sectarian dialectal differentiation and sociolinguistic variation in the Arabic-speaking countries. It is based on the studies that have been conducted so far in the fields of dialectology and sociolinguistics to investigate this issue. The first section reminds the reader of the diversity of sociolinguistic situations in the region in terms of the extent of religious differentiation within a city/area. The second section summarizes the trigger of situations of major religious/sectarian differentiation and the factors that led to their stability for many decades or centuries. It also presents three contemporary evolution processes observable in the areas with major differentiation and some contemporary loci of observation of sectarian/religious variation in areas of minor differentiation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sociolinguistic consensus suggests that corpora should be sharable to permit broader comparisons across regions and across social groups. Recent studies of available corpora have shown that one variable rarely made available for sociolinguistic comparison is religion (Yaeger-Dror and Cieri, 2013; Yaeger-Dror, 2014). The present special issue was solicited to demonstrate the importance of religion, and of individual speakers' religious commitment, to the study of sociolinguistic variation. In each study the author finds not only that religion is a meaningful sociolinguistic variable, but that geolinguistic considerations impact on 'religiolinguistic' (Hary and Wein, 2013) choices in intricate ways. Commitment to a specific sub-group within a larger religious denomination is relevant, as is a speaker's religious ideology; while addressee design and social network influences often appear indistinguishable from referee design, the two may be more easily distinguished from each other when religious denomination and ideology are factored into a study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the sociolinguistic effects of multilingualism in urban settings around the world, as international immigration has resulted in formerly monolingual urban centres becoming increasingly diverse, both ethnically and linguistically. Clearly, such major changes in the linguistic make-up of many major cities in Europe and North America can be expected to have sociolinguistic consequences, and new patterns of sociolinguistic variation observed in the majority languages (MLs) as spoken by native-born multilingual young people have been labelled by some researchers as ‘ethnolects’ or ‘multiethnolects’ (Carlock and Wölck 1981; Kotsinas 1988a; Quist 2000, 2008). ‘(Multi)ethnolects’ are reported in European cities with MLs such as Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian and Swedish (Doran 2002, 2004; Kallmeyer and Keim 2003; see Chapter 1, this volume) and in English-speaking cities in North America, the UK and Australia (e.g. Hoffman and Walker 2010; Kerswill, Torgersen and Fox 2008; Kiesling 2005; Chapter 2, this volume). In order for a set of linguistic features to be considered to be a new variety that could be labelled a ‘(multi)ethnolect’, we argue (following Fraurud and Boyd 2011, Hudson 1996 and Ferguson 1994) that at least two conditions should hold: first, users of the putative variety should orient themselves either to a specific ethnic origin (ethnolect) or to a general ‘non-mainstream’ identity (multiethnolect); second, the features of the putative new variety should be shared by a significant proportion of the individuals who orient themselves to their ethnolinguistic identity, should be used frequently and regularly, and should be identified as characteristic of these users. (An additional criterion, not explored in this chapter, is that variables should also show linguistic conditioning differing from that of mainstream speakers (Hoffman and Walker 2010).) If these conditions are not met (e.g. either group membership or linguistic variation are more diffuse and unfocused), we argue that there is little reason to consider the features to be anything other than part and parcel of the patterns of sociolinguistic variation found in multilingual urban centres (see e.g. Jaspers 2008; Quist 2008; Chapters 2 and 3, this volume). In this case, we argue that the speakers should be considered to be part of a single speech community (cf. Labov 1972b: 120–1; Patrick 2002) that, like all others, is characterized by sociolinguistic variation. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

This article presents findings from the first major study to investigate lexical variation and change in British Sign Language (BSL) number signs. As part of the BSL Corpus Project, number sign variants were elicited from 249 deaf signers from eight sites throughout the UK. Age, school location, and language background were found to be significant predictors for the use of regional number sign variants. The results suggest that leveling may be taking place in BSL number signs inasmuch as younger signers are using a decreasing variety of regionally distinct number sign variants. These results need to be understood in light of the sociolinguistic characteristics of the British deaf community, which differ from those of spoken language communities, with which linguists are more familiar.

Among French-based creoles, Haitian Creole has the highest degree of standardization, with a written norm, Standard Haitian Creole (SHC), based on Portau- Prince monolinguals' speech. To evaluate the influence of SHC on regional varieties, we conducted, in and around Cap Haïtien, a sociolinguistic study of Northern Haitian Creole (Capois). In addition to stereotypical features such as the possessive kin a + pronoun (vs. SHC pa + pronoun), we uncovered several Capois features still in widespread use in Northern Haiti. In this article, we focus on the most frequently occurring variable, the third person singular pronoun (3sg), which alternates between SHC li/l, and Capois i/y. We show that SHC li has yet to replace Capois i, which is preferred by a large proportion of community members. For both the rural and urban populations, this variable is conditioned by syntactic and phonological factors. Despite shared tendencies, urban speakers' lower rate of Capois variant use and stronger phonological conditioning may be due to their greater exposure to speakers from other areas of Haiti, and to closer contact with the standard. Although most speakers, especially older ones, recognized SHC's higher prestige, they evidenced more positive attitudes toward their own speech. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This article is a quantitative study of the variable deletion of post-obstruent /l/ and /R/ in word-final obstruent-liquid clusters (OLC) in French (capable [kapab(l)], cidre [sid(Ê')]). The analysis of over a thousand tokens extracted from a corpus of interviews gathered in Nancy and Rennes shows that the reduction of word-final OLCs is a stable sociolinguistic marker in northern, standardised metropolitan French. Patterns of stylistic and social stratification in age, gender, and social class and interaction with following phonological context are attested, but OLC reduction does not appear to be an ongoing change. It is argued that the data provide further evidence of variable morpheme-final consonant clusters as a 'primitive' feature of vernacular dialects. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

Following the Labovian variationist approach, this research study analyzes the use of the themes and characters in a sample of 192 oral personal experience narratives in the Spanish spoken in Santiago, Chile. We aim at establishing the frequency of use of this variables elements and testing whether there exists variation among the sociodemographic factors -sex, age, and socioeconomic group- of the speakers and the use of the said resources, in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our data analysis shows that there is sociolinguistic variation in the use of the themes and characters in personal experience narratives, specifically, regarding the sex factor.

The present study connects research on the L2 acquisition of variable structures to the ever-growing body of research on the role of study abroad in the language learning process. The data come from a group of 46 English-speaking learners of Spanish who participated in immersion programs in two distinct locations, Valencia, Spain and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. Simultaneously, we tested a group of native speakers from each region to create an appropriate target model for each learner group. Learners completed a written contextualized questionnaire at the beginning and end of their seven-week stay abroad. Our instrument examines three variable grammatical structures: (1) the copulas ser and estar in pre-adjectival contexts, (2) the preterit and the present perfect in past-time contexts, and (3) the simple present and present progressive in present-time contexts. Findings indicate an overall development of sociolinguistic competence abroad, but to a differing extent depending upon the variable structure analyzed. © 2015 by De Gruyter Mouton 2015.

The position of wh-items is one of the most striking features of the syntax of sign languages (SLs). In contrast to spoken languages, where wh-words are generally found either clause-initially or in situ, SLs allow wh-signs in situ, in clause-final position (preferred for many SLs), or repeated in two different positions of the clause. Moreover, in many cases all these options coexist in the same language (and even within a single signer). Several proposals in the theoretical literature showed how grammars are able to generate such constructions; however, none of the proposals addresses the issue of what factors determine the choice of these options. We present corpus evidence showing that both linguistic and social factors constrain the distribution of wh-signs in LIS (Lingua dei Segni Italiana, Italian Sign Language). The result of multivariate analysis suggests that LIS is undergoing a grammatical change and becoming less like spoken Italian with respect to the position of wh-signs. © 2015 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Munich/Boston.

The technological advances associated with Web 2.0 allow people to interact in online ‘communities’ built around shared interests and concerns. So far, research in language attitudes and folk linguistics has made only limited use of naturally occurring discourse in these environments. This article examines an online messageboard virtually located in North East England, and explores the ways in which participants’ beliefs about and attitudes towards sociolinguistic variation emerge through discourse. I focus on a single ‘conversation’, revealing the language ideologies which inform the sociolinguistic awareness of participants, and conclude by using the concept of ‘late modernity’ as an ‘interpretive frame’ (Harris, 2011) to help understand what is happening as people appropriate a global technology for local social action. © 2015, EQUINOX PUBLISHING

This article reviews corpus-based Chinese studies, both applied and theoretical, from the 1920s to the present. It will be shown that, while corpus-based Chinese studies have been gaining momentum for only the last couple of decades, the roots of Chinese corpus linguistics go all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century. Today the bulk of corpus-based Chinese studies is oriented toward applied linguistics, with the compilation of frequency character/word lists and interlanguage Chinese studies being the most popular types of research. In addition to applied linguistic studies, this overview also highlights some innovative corpus studies on lexical and grammatical aspects of both classical and modern Chinese, as well as studies of sociolinguistic variation and discourse pragmatics. Overall, important groundwork in Chinese corpus linguistics is acknowledged and future directions are discussed. © 2015 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

How do people use sign languages in different situations around the world? How are sign languages distributed globally? What happens when they come in contact with spoken and written languages? These and other questions are explored in this new introduction to the sociolinguistics of sign languages and deaf communities. An international team brings insights and data from a wide range of sign languages, from the USA, Canada, England, Spain, Brazil and Australia. Topics covered include multilingualism in the global deaf community, sociolinguistic variation and change in sign languages, bilingualism and language contact between signed and spoken languages, attitudes towards sign languages, sign language planning and policy, and sign language discourse. Sociolinguistics and Deaf Communities will be welcomed by students of sign language and interpreting, teachers of sign language, and students and academics working in linguistics. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

Indexing the gender of the speaker or the addressee within any type of sentence is often considered as sociolinguistic variation rather than as a gender-exclusive rule. This paper presents a survey of categorical (rather than statistical) gender indexicality in grammar with the greatest number of languages to date. It also offers a data-informed typology of categorical gender indexicality based on 41 indigenous South American languages, aimed at encouraging and facilitating research on genderlects. Examples are classified according to which speech-act participants have their gender indexed and in which area of the grammar (lexicon, discourse markers, phonology, morphology). The main findings are, first, that categorical gender indexicality in the grammar is more frequent than thought and, second, that the weight of gender indexicality within a language is correlated to the domain: it is limited in the lexicon, more present with discourse markers, and pervasive at the phonological and morphological levels. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

Mouthings and mouth gestures are omnipresent in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). Mouthings in NGT are mouth actions that have their origin in spoken Dutch, and are usually time aligned with the signs they co-occur with. Frequently, however, they spread over one or more adjacent signs, so that one mouthing co-occurs with multiple manual signs. We conducted a corpus study to explore how frequently this occurs in NGT and whether there is any sociolinguistic variation in the use of spreading. Further, we looked at the circumstances under which spreading occurs. Answers to these questions may give us insight into the prosodic structure of sign languages. We investigated a sample of the Corpus NGT containing 5929 mouthings by 46 participants. We found that spreading over an adjacent sign is independent of social factors. Further, mouthings that spread are longer than non-spreading mouthings, whether measured in syllables or in milliseconds. By using a relatively large amount of natural data, we succeeded in gaining more insight into the way mouth actions are utilised in sign languages. © The Author(s) 2013.

Stylistic variation plays a pivotal role in the field of sociolinguistic variation in that it sheds light on speakers strategies with respect to external variables and allows linguists to observe ongoing linguistic change (see Labov 1966; Eckert and Rickford 2001; Schilling-Estes 2002). Stylistic variation can be observed between speakers (inter-speaker variation) as well as in the speech of individual speakers (intraspeaker variation). As Schilling-Estes (2002: 375) notes, a range of different types of variation are associated with intra-speaker variation, ‘including shifts in usage levels for features associated with particular groups of speakers - i.e. DIALECTS - or with particular situations of use - i.e. REGISTERS’. Over the last forty years, intra-speaker variation (from a synchronic perspective) has been approached in a number of different ways. It is noteworthy that discussions on how to define stylistic variation are ongoing (for selected studies, see, for instance, Eckert and Rickford 2001; Auer 2007). To date, three major approaches to stylistic variation can be identified, namely (1) Attention to Speech, (2) Audience Design and (3) Speaker Design (see Schilling-Estes 2002). The first, i.e. Attention to Speech, is strongly associated with William Labov’s New York City study (1966), which launched quantitative research on language variation. In this study, Labov ‘established that stylistic variation constitutes a crucial nexus between the individual and the community - between the linguistic, the cognitive, and the social’ (Eckert and Rickford 2001: 2). He showed that the use of sociolinguistic variables is closely connected with social-class variation and that the stylistic repertoire of each speaker may be seen as a continuum within the socioeconomic hierarchy. The upper end of this continuum charts the ‘prestigious’ realisation of the speaker’s speech, which may be seen as the result of more careful, formal speech, while the lower ‘stigmatised’ end can be considered the result of more casual and unmonitored speech. The speaker’s stylistic choices are thus closely associated with the socioeconomic hierarchy, i.e. in particular with the speaker’s place within it and his/her strategies with regard to the hierarchy. Of central importance in Labov’s theory is the degree of attention that speakers pay to their speech. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

When considering variables that are rarely coded for in sociolinguistic studies, we discovered that general demographic studies [e.g., the census, Pew Research studies] have only recently realized that the question sets provided for demographic information rarely permit coding of religion, or when they do, provide only coarse-grained coding; yet recent studies in sociolinguistics and social anthropology have demonstrated that fine-grained distinctions in religious identification are necessary to account for sociolinguistic variation. This paper reviews the information from both sociolinguistic studies and demographic studies which should be considered when developing a protocol for analysis of speech variation. The paper also points out that the variation is often due to network effects from the 'community of practice', but at least some of the variation can be traced to ideological positions or choice of referee, both of which appear to influence language use. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Background: Natural variability in speech is a significant challenge to robust successful spoken word recognition. In everyday listening environments, listeners must quickly adapt and adjust to multiple sources of variability in both the signal and listening environments. High-variability speech may be particularly difficult to understand for non-native listeners, who have less experience with the second language (L2) phonological system and less detailed knowledge of sociolinguistic variation of the L2. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-variability sentences on nonnative speech recognition and to explore the underlying sources of individual differences in speech recognition abilities of non-native listeners. Research Design: Participants completed two sentence recognition tasks involving high-variability and low-variability sentences. They also completed a battery of behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires designed to assess their indexical processing skills, vocabulary knowledge, and several core neurocognitive abilities. Study Sample: Native speakers of Mandarin (n = 25) living in the United States recruited from the Indiana University community participated in the current study. A native comparison group consisted of scores obtained from native speakers of English (n = 21) in the Indiana University community taken from an earlier study. Data Collection and Analysis: Speech recognition in high-variability listening conditions was assessed with a sentence recognition task using sentences from PRESTO (Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-Set) mixed in 6-talker multitalker babble. Speech recognition in low-variability listening conditions was assessed using sentences fromHINT (Hearing In Noise Test) mixed in 6-talker multitalker babble. Indexical processing skills were measured using a talker discrimination task, a gender discrimination task, and a forced-choice regional dialect categorization task. Vocabulary knowledge was assessed with the WordFam word familiarity test, and executive functioning was assessed with the BRIEF-A (Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version) self-report questionnaire. Scores from the non-native listeners on behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires were compared with scores obtained from native listeners tested in a previous study and were examined for individual differences. Results: Non-native keyword recognition scores were significantly lower on PRESTO sentences than on HINT sentences. Non-native listeners' keyword recognition scores were also lower than native listeners' scores on both sentence recognition tasks. Differences in performance on the sentence recognition tasks between non-native and native listeners were larger on PRESTO than on HINT, although group differences varied by signal-to-noise ratio. The non-native and native groups also differed in the ability to categorize talkers by region of origin and in vocabulary knowledge. Individual non-native word recognition accuracy on PRESTO sentences in multitalker babble at more favorable signal-to-noise ratios was found to be related to several BRIEF-A subscales and composite scores. However, non-native performance on PRESTO was not related to regional dialect categorization, talker and gender discrimination, or vocabulary knowledge. Conclusions: High-variability sentences in multitalker babble were particularly challenging for nonnative listeners. Difficulty under high-variability testing conditions was related to lack of experience with the L2, especially L2 sociolinguistic information, compared with native listeners. Individual differences among the non-native listeners were related to weaknesses in core neurocognitive abilities affecting behavioral control in everyday life.

This paper is a corpus-based study of the Bathroom Formula, a speech act that refers to the phrases speakers use to express their need to leave any ongoing activity in order to go to the bathroom (e.g., I'm gonna go to the bathroom). The data were retrieved from the Longman Spoken American Corpus, the Michigan Corpus of Spoken Academic English and the spoken component of the British National Corpus. More than 80 'anchor' words and phrases found in the literature were searched for (e.g., loo, pee, wash my hands). The results show that a large majority of all instances are based on a small number of lexicalized sentence stems (I ((SEMI-)MODAL) V to the bathroom/loo/restroom/toilet; I ((SEMI-)MODAL) (go) pee/. potty). It is argued that the lack of creativity is connected to ease of comprehension and production and to speakers' wish to be unobtrusive. Apart from some lexical differences between the regional varieties (e.g., AmE bathroom and BrE loo) there was little sociolinguistic variation. The desire to be unobtrusive is also reflected in the responses to the formula: about half the tokens are not responded to at all, and the most common verbal response involves simple acknowledgements (e.g., okay). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The acquisition of sociolinguistic variation by second language learners has gained increased attention. Some research highlights the value of naturalistic exposure through study abroad while other studies point out that classroom input can facilitate the acquisition of particular features of variation. Nevertheless, said attention to the intersection of sociolinguistic variation and second language acquisition is not always reflected in curricular content and pedagogy. As one example, Spanish language classrooms often do not cover voseo, which is defined as the use of the pronoun vos or the corresponding verbal morphology, even though learners are typically presented with other types of variation in personal forms of address. This article discusses reasons why voseo is typically excluded in the language classroom, offers a rationale for its inclusion at the intermediate level that connects with the objectives of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) in Communication, Cultures, Comparisons, and Communities, and articulates a series of activities designed to help language learners recognize and respond appropriately to conversational voseo usage. The suggested learning units are framed within the interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational modes of communication and thus promote general language learning while specifically enhancing intermediate learners' sociolinguistic awareness of this particular dialectal feature. © 2014 AATSP Copyright.

This article comprises a sociolinguistic analysis of the distribution of northern features in two sixteenth-century collections of wills of urban and rural provenance (York Clergy Wills and Swaledale Wills and Inventories, respectively). It is suggested that there is a correlation between dialect features such as the Northern Subject Rule, the uninflected genitive, and the third person plural pronouns and the urban or rural provenance of the wills as well as, to some extent, the social rank of the testators. This sheds light on how social factors might condition the resilience of dialect features in sixteenth-century northern English. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

Using texts selected from the C-Oral-Rom corpus, this study considers how linguistic and sociolinguistic variables affect liaison. In the majority of cases, liaison appears on monosyllabic function words. Individual lexemes differ greatly in rate of liaison. With regard to sociolinguistic variation, female speakers realize liaison consonants more often than male speakers, younger speakers realize it more often than older speakers, and liaison rates for speakers without university degree are higher than for speakers with university degree. Results are discussed in the light of models of prosodic structure and with respect to their implications for models of socio-linguistic variation. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2015.

This paper investigates the role of orthographic representation in the production of the local variant of the STRUT vowel in the speech of Polish migrants living in Manchester. A previous study (Drummond 2013) showed that acquisition of the local variant depended on various social factors, yet this only took into account conversation data, leaving some word list data unexplored. Comparing the two data sets reveals a difference in degree of acquisition, with the word list data producing more of the local vowel. This is explained not as a case of dialect acquisition as such, but more as an effect of orthography triggering a connection to the L1 phonology, the particular nature of which mimics acquisition of the local variant. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

Variable case marking of pronouns in coordinate noun phrases (CoNPs) is a well-documented phenomenon which has elicited prescriptive censure for centuries. Drawing on the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, this study presents a detailed quantitative analysis of variable case marking in CoNPs in the Quebec English Corpus (Poplack, Walker and Malcolmson 2006), a massive compendium of vernacular speech. Operationalizing a number of extralinguistic and linguistic factors that are claimed to condition variable case marking in CoNPs, multivariate analysis revealed that speaker age and education as well as the syntactic position of the CoNP are key predictors in determining the case of pronouns in these constructions. An important finding is that case marking in CoNPs is highly variable for speakers, suggesting that the Sisyphean efforts of the prescriptive enterprise to impose uniformity on this area of the grammar have been to little avail as far as spontaneous usage is concerned. Comparison of the results with variable case marking in CoNPs in other varieties of English, vas well as with diachronic patterns of variability, also raises the possibility that the accusative is increasingly assuming the role of default case in coordinate constructions. © 2014 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This article focuses on the development of sociolinguistic competence in a second language, (here, French being acquired by young Anglo-Montrealers) in a naturalistic context where the target language is part of daily life. Sociolinguistic competence is assessed through analysis of Anglo-Montrealers’ use of a morphosyntactic variable, Future Temporal Reference (FTR), in both French and English. Variationist analyses reveal that Anglo-Montrealers possess distinct FTR variation systems for each of the languages of their linguistic repertoire. Results show that substantial contact with native speakers is a necessary condition for detailed and complete mastery of target sociolinguistic variation, in particular because the rules that govern it are rarely, if ever, explicitly taught. © The Author(s) 2013.

Small Caribbean islands offer a unique venue for examining principles of language contact and sociolinguistic variation. Only recently, however, has the use of acoustics-based analysis been incorporated as a tool for the phonological description and analysis of Caribbean varieties. This study offers the first empirical description and analysis of the English spoken on the island of Saba, a Dutch municipality located in the Eastern Caribbean. Data come from 22 sociolinguistic interviews with long-term residents conducted on Saba in 2012. Phonological and morphosyntactic features are analyzed with respect to the interrelationship between effects from community, ethnicity, and generation. Overall, this study contributes to the important process of phonological and morphosyntactic documentation of lesser-known Caribbean varieties, highlighting the usefulness of acoustics-based and statistical analyses in such processes. © 2014 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

The paper explores the use of vocatives in a corpus of 24 American and British films (the Pavia Corpus of Film Dialogue) by comparing film dialogue with spontaneous speech. A systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of empirical data is provided to assess how address forms used by English speakers in natural verbal exchanges are reproduced on screen, and to identify patterns of address that can be regarded as distinctive of film dialogue. The findings show a higher frequency of vocatives in film dialogue, which serve diegetic and extradiegetic functions. From a qualitative point of view, filmic speech effectively reproduces interpersonal functions and sociolinguistic variation associated with vocatives in spontaneous interactions; on the other hand, it is characterized by a sophisticated use of address strategies accounted for in terms of authorial expressivity.© John Benjamins Publishing Company.

Global measures of lexical competition, such as lexical neighborhood density, assume that all phonological contrasts contribute equally to competition. However, effects of local phonetic similarity have also been observed in speech production processes, suggesting that some contrasts may lead to greater competition than others. In the current study, the effect of local lexical competition on vowel production was examined across two dialects of American English that differ in the phonetic similarity of the low-front and low-back vowel pairs. Results revealed a significant interaction between regional dialect and local lexical competition on the acoustic distance within each vowel pair. Local lexical contrast led to greater acoustic distance between vowels, as expected, but this effect was significantly enhanced for acoustically similar dialect-specific variants. These results were independent of global neighborhood density, suggesting that local lexical competition may contribute to the realization of sociolinguistic variation and phonological change. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

Recent research has suggested that the contribution of individual sociolinguistic variables to the social perception of a speaker is influenced by other available information about the speaker (Campbell-Kibler, 2007; Pharao, Maegaard, Spindler Moller, & Kristiansen, 2014). Here we investigate the impact of listener awareness of regional sociolinguistic variation on sociolinguistic perception. Specifically, we compare how the social meanings attributed to word-internal, preconsonantal /s/ differ based on whether the listeners and speakers use predominantly /s/-weakening Puerto Rican Spanish or predominantly non-/s/-weakening Mexican Spanish. We find that for measures of status, Puerto Rican and Mexican listeners both show a smaller effect of /s/ when rating Puerto Rican as opposed to Mexican speakers. However, we see no effect of speaker nationality on heteronormativity, and Puerto Rican listeners and male Mexican listeners rate strong /s/ as less heteronormative across the board. Mexican female listeners, however, rate strong /s/ as more heteronormative. These results suggest that listeners integrate their own local ideologies with their understanding of regional differences when socially evaluating language variation.

Rule- and usage-based models in phonology are difficult to reconcile: 'rule'-based approaches (including generative and optimality models) rely on abstraction and seek to account for regularity and generality. Usage-based models, like exemplar theory, rely on concrete representations, eschewing abstraction; they typically seek to account for lexically differentiated phonological phenomena, including variability, gradience and probabilistic properties. An alternative that incorporates both generative productivity and quantitative precision is the "variable rule" (VR) model of sociolinguistic variation. VR preserves advantages of rule-based models, including abstraction and the capacity to represent categorical processes. But VR resolves many limitations of these formalisms using probabilistic quantification: any phonological process or constraint may be associated with a probability, which permits the treatment of variation and gradience. This paper cites evidence from variation in speech style, child language, and reanalysis across the life span showing that speakers have both discrete abstract and nondiscrete, variable elements of phonology. Variable processes provide a nondeterministic but recoverable link between these different representations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Following the Labovian variationist approach, this research study analyzes the use of the historical present in a sample of 192 oral personal experience narratives in the Spanish spoken in Santiago, Chile. We aim at establishing the frequency of use of this variable element and testing whether there exists variation among the sociodemographic factors - sex, age, and socioeconomic group- of the speakers and the use of the said resource. We also describe its place in the narrative structure (Labov & Waletzky, 1967; Labov, 1983 [1972]) and the function it performs in the narratives (Silva-Corvalán, 1983, 2001). Our data analysis shows that, firstly, there is sociolinguistic variation in the use of the historical present in personal experience narratives, specifically, among women of 20 to 34 years and over 55 in the four socioeconomic groups studied, presenting statistical significance. Secondly, our analysis indicates that it is possible to consider the historical present as a variable phenomenon with a specific function, namely, that of being an evaluative resource (Labov, 1972; Silva-Corvalán, 1983, 2001). Finally, we could establish that this phenomenon is located in the narrative complication (Silva-Corvalán, 1983, 2001).

This article explores US English speakers' perception of subject-verb agreement variation by using self-paced reading and mouse tracking. Two experiments exposed participants to standard, nonstandard, and uncommon subject-verb combinations. Experiment 1 measures participants' reading times, and experiment 2 measures their social judgments. The standard forms are [singular+doesn't] and [plural+don't]. The nonstandard form is [singular+don't], which is attested widely across English varieties; the "uncommon" form was [plural+doesn't]. Experiment 1 was a self-paced reading experiment, wherein participants read sentences word by word at their own pace. Reading times were slowed the most for uncommon agreement, and nonstandard agreement was also processed more slowly than standard agreement, showing that processing is sensitive to sociolinguistic variation. Experiment 2 was a mouse-tracking experiment, wherein participants read sentences and then chose between two photographs to indicate whether a high- or low-status speaker was more likely to say the sentence. Sentences with the nonstandard and uncommon patterns were more likely to be assigned to low-status speakers than were standard sentences. However, participants' mouse movements showed that the decision-making processes for uncommon sentences were more like those of standard sentences. Implications for the understanding of sociolinguistic knowledge are discussed. © 2014 SAGE Publications.

This article presents three perspectives in the study of Spanish/English contact in a community of rural Puerto Rico. First, it presents an analysis of variation based on the presence of English forms in recorded conversational Spanish. Second, it provides a view of the social context of Spanish/English contact by examining responses to a sociological questionnaire focusing on the use of "Spanish Only" versus Spanish and English in spheres of community life. Third, it highlights speaker commentary on social factors in relation to the use of Spanish and English. The study shows that the presence of English in the recorded conversational Spanish is extremely limited and that Spanish dominates in community life. Nevertheless, the presence of English in both conversational Spanish and social spheres within the community reveals patterns in relation to social factors recognized by speakers. © 2013 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language (ODNZSL),1 launched in 2011, is an example of a contemporary sign language dictionary that leverages the 21st century advantages of a digital medium and an existing body of descriptive research on the language, including a small electronic corpus of New Zealand Sign Language. Innovations in recent online dictionaries of other signed languages informed development of this bilingual, bi-directional, multimedia dictionary. Video content and search capacities in an online medium are a huge advance in more directly representing a signed lexicon and enabling users to access content in versatile ways, yet do not resolve all of the theoretical challenges that face sign language dictionary makers. Considerations in the editing and production of the ODNZSL are discussed in this article, including issues of determining lexemes and word class in a polysynthetic language, deriving usage examples from a small corpus, and dealing with sociolinguistic variation in the selection and performance of content.

This article presents an empirical description of the use of the Norwegian tonal accents 1 and 2 respectively in the pronunciation of the noun-derivational suffix <-asje> as it appears in loan-words from French <-age> (from LL <-aticum>), directly or via Dutch, English or German. Historically, tonal accent 1 has been general in Norwegian usage, but during the later decades an inter-as well as intraindividual variation has been noticeable. The author has elicited that variation from television programmes from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK = Norsk rikskringkasting), which are available for scrutiny in the company archives. His study shows a distribution of the two tonal accents in which the innovative tonal accent 2 is used predominantly by younger people and more often by women than men. In a concluding discussion, the author compares his findings with a proposed rule that takes tonal accent 2 in noun-derivational suffixes in lent verbs to be a sign of true norwegianization and the same tonal accent to be the unmarked one in Norwegian. He finds that rule problematic, as the most frequent of the nouns in question show no inclination towards the use of tonal accent 2 in general-language practice. Finally, the article evaluates the connotational preconditions in the present tonal accent variation for the future progress of tonal accent 2 usage.

This article examines dialectal language use in the description of the relationship between the protagonist Kalle and his wife Laina in the Iijoki series of novels by Kalle Päätalo. The research material comprises 13 novels, all of which focus on the marriage between Kalle and Laina. The research investigates the dialectal features used to describe the development of the characters' relationship and the discursive methods used in the construction and collapse of the relationship. The analysis demonstrates how language variation contributes to the thematic structure of the story. The dialectal features in the dialogue between Kalle and Laina also display a metapragmatic function. The use of dialectal language illustrates a specific method of using language in fiction that mirrors the structures of natural language but which functions independently, thereby complementing the thematic features of the novel.The study is founded in sociolinguistic variation analysis used in tandem with an ethnodialectological approach. The examination of the discursive use of dialectal features utilises critical discourse-analytical theories regarding the dynamics of context and language; the dialogue is thus a negotiation of the setting of the relationship in which dialectal language plays a part.The analysis reveals that the same phonological features can contribute to both relationship-making and relationship-breaking dialogue. For instance, Kalle comments upon and mimics the following features in his wife's dialect: the non-gradational consonant cluster nk, past tense forms of i-stemmed verbs with the diphthong ei (e.g., opein), and the si past tense form. Laina in turn most frequently comments upon the schwa vowel, the use of deletion in place of the weak form of f, as well as general gemination. In the relationship-breaking dialogue Laina brings up nearly all the features of East Finnish dialects, such as the diphthongisation of the long vowels aa and ää, the use of the cluster ht in place of ts, labialisation, and diphthong reduction.The characters' speech variation is a key feature of the description of the relationship between Kalle and Laina. Initially the description and mimicry of the characters' respective dialects are used to build a rapport between Kalle and Laina. When Päätalo describes marital problems, the spouses' dialects also come into conflict. In addition to the narrative, the author uses linguistic variation in dialogue to illustrate his characters, their social relationships and changes thereof.

This article focuses on the description and interpretation of the social meaning of sociolinguistic variation in Athenian suburban speech. A descriptive statistical and a Varbrul analysis of the syntactic variable Verb and presence or absence of Prepositional Phrase (V +/- PP), as it is used by native northern and western suburbanites of Athens, suggests that primarily the area (northern and western suburbia) and, to a lesser extent, the sex of the speakers are statistically significant macro social factors constraining variation. In an effort to tease out the social meaning of the variation, a further analysis of some micro factors within each area, including the group of speak ers, the topic, and the stance towards the rivalry between the aforementioned suburban areas, suggests that variation in both areas is interactionally constrained, but in the northern area it tends to be more friendship group-constrained, while in the western area it is more education-constrained. In light of these findings, the sociolinguistic implications of the study translate into the analytical need to account for the relationship between interactional and social factors in the description of variable grammars. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2013.

The aim of this article is to deal with structural and functional issues regarding the expression TIPO, in constructions such as ci vediamo tipo alle cinque. This paper argues that this element is not simply a filler, but is linked to particular focus issues. After a review of the previous accounts of TIPO, particularly in dictionaries and semantic studies, the article concentrates on formal, functional, and pragmatic issues concerning TIPO structures. This element seems to have interesting functions when put in specific environments. The sample of the study is made up of middle-class young people aged eighteen to twenty-five. TIPO rarely appears in written texts, so it seems to be a typical element of spoken texts of Italian native speakers. © Italian Studies at the Universities of Cambridge, Leeds and Reading 2013.

This article focuses on memory, orality and storytelling as a strategy of the pedagogical work of teachers in basic education schools in indigenous communities Roraima, and the indigenous oral narrative focus of the continuing education course "The Interactional Process in Classes Mother Tongue: Text in Context" by the Center for Training of Education Professionals Roraima - CEFORR . The course is a joint action with the "Bridges Project," the research group coordinated by Prof. Dra. Stella Maris Bortoni - Ricardo, of UNB, which aims to equip teachers in classroom activities concerning the development of reading, exercise of orality and textual production, in order to recognize the linguistic and cultural diversity to work taking into account the traditional practices as legends, folk tales, memory. The State of Roraima has a strong presence of indigenous culture in their social and population. In this context, we observe the occurrence of conflicts demarcation of indigenous lands, generating the prejudice and socioeconomic and ethno cultural devaluation of indigenous peoples, whether in language, its history or its traditions and, on the other hand, a strong political organization and the existence of practices aimed at preserving the memory of the communities served through oral tradition, which has one of the elements in the narratives producers identities, in a perspective of literary studies and interface to sociolinguistic studies in relation to theory continues. In using this theory to the research of Brazilian Portuguese, explores different categories of sociolinguistic variation: diatopic, diastrática, diamésica, diafásica and diachronic, as the object of investigation. Here, we explore the effect diamésica from orality to writing, the recording of oral histories and traditional experienced by indigenous peoples. Having as a methodological approach to collaborative ethnography of linguistic studies, it was adopted for collecting and generating data , oral history and record with the formation of a portfolio with texts of various genres produced by the students, under the supervision of teachers and teacher students with the guidance of the course tutor. It is hoped that teachers build with a set of records of their oral practices to serve the repertoire for the production of knowledge of cultural practices for enjoyment in school practices .

This paper argues that the linguistic situation in Arabic defies any rigid demarcation and dichotomization; therefore, it proposes an alternative approach to the analysis of the Arabic linguistic situation - the Variation Approach. The proposed approach assumes that (a) the probabilistic use of linguistic items correlates with an index of stylistic, economic, and socio-political variables shared by all members of any Arab speech community, and (b) in dealing with variation in Arabic, it is important to study (1) each individual linguistic variable and its behavior as an independent unit within the same linguistic level, and (2) the relationship between variables across linguistic levels, i.e. the hierarchy and implication of the application, and (3) the variable sensitivity of the linguistic variables to socio-stylistic contexts and social evaluation within the same community and across communities. In light of the new model, the paper highlights some of the most common variation patterns that may exist in any given Arab speech community. Finally, it surveys the major factors that my influence and shape the dominant patterns of variation in the Arab world.

This article presents the results of a study centered on the effect of instruction on second language (L2) learners' sociolinguistic awareness, with specific focus on French negative structures (i.e., presence vs. absence of ne). Drawing on data from a metalinguistic awareness questionnaire completed by 110 US university learners of French in five different groups, we examine the extent to which instruction versus no instruction influences awareness of variation as well as differences among three approaches to instruction (i.e., integrated curriculum vs. one-time explicit instruction vs. one-time nonexplicit intervention). Our results show that some form of instruction is better than no instruction. However, the type of instruction is also a crucial factor. Following the presentation of the results, we discuss the role of sociolinguistic knowledge in relation to L2 performance abilities. Pedagogical implications are also provided. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship between perceived nativelikeness and scrutinized nativelikeness is examined in very advanced L2 French and L2 Spanish. First, native speaker judges are asked to evaluate the speech of non-native speakers and native speakers of both languages, determining whether they pass as native speakers. Four non-native participants from each language group are then analyzed in more detail. Interviews with these speakers are analyzed with respect to formulaic language use and morphosyntax. No obvious differences between speakers who pass as native and those who do not are found. Subsequently, the short excerpts used in the evaluations are closely analyzed, in search for other possible differences. It is found that speakers who pass as native speakers use regional variation to a larger extent. It is thus proposed that there is no necessary connection between perceived nativelikeness and scrutinized nativelikeness and that passing as a native speaker may be more linked to sociolinguistic competence than linguistic competence. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this article, I discuss the accomplishments of scholars of language and culture in 2012 and the questions raised by those accomplishments. I review matters of language-expansions and refinements of existing research topics, including linguistic relativity, language socialization, sociolinguistic variation, and language ideologies. I then consider a trend of research on topics of embodiment, materiality, and the senses, discussing the matter (in the physics sense) of language. I then use the term engagement to comment on developments in research on language endangerment, language circulation and shift, language and health, language and education, and language and social justice. This is rooted in the notion that language makes a difference (or matters) in cultural practice. I conclude with a brief discussion of the ontology of language, the epistemology of linguistic anthropology, and the roles of scholars of language and culture in anthropology as a whole. © 2013 by the American Anthropological Association.

This paper deals with the issue of social variation at the level of syntax, investigating wh-movement and subject-verb-inversion (stylistic inversion) in wh-constructions in European French. It proposes an analysis of the subjective side of social structure, in terms of the sociocultural theory of Bourdieu and the lifestyle concept. Furthermore, this work shows that acceptability judgments do represent a valid and insight-providing source of evidence in sociolinguistics. Statistical analyses of variance are first calculated with (language-)internal, and then with both internal and (language-)external variables. This two-step strategy reflects the transition from a perspective of a commonly shared system of syntax to one of social variation. The results show that lifestyle is a very prominent element of the variable set. It can be fruitfully applied even when a sample is less diverse from a sociodemographic point of view. These findings underline that a more sophisticated social structure analysis can reveal salient patterns of sociolinguistic variation that would otherwise remain undetected. ©2013 Elsevier BV.

Although developmental sociolinguistics is a relatively under-researched field, several studies have described children's use of sociolinguistic variables and some have suggested theoretical accounts for the learning mechanisms underpinning their acquisition. Taking a historical point of view, this paper aims firstly to provide an exhaustive review of the studies focused on phonological variables over the past four decades. In the second section, we then deal with three theoretical approaches to the acquisition of variation: abstract variable rule formation, case-by-case concrete learning and exemplar theory. We discuss the main assumptions of these accounts, such as the role of input frequency, abstraction and generalization processes and the construction of the relationship between linguistic and social information. Finally, in the light of this discussion and in line with the available results, we argue in favor of the usage-based theory of language acquisition (Tomasello 2003) as a general framework including exemplar theory and explaining how children learn variable and categorical linguistic forms as well as their social use. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

This paper investigates phonological variation in British Sign Language (BSL) signs produced with a '1' hand configuration in citation form. Multivariate analyses of 2084 tokens reveals that handshape variation in these signs is constrained by linguistic factors (e.g., the preceding and following phonological environment, grammatical category, indexicality, lexical frequency). The only significant social factor was region. For the subset of signs where orientation was also investigated, only grammatical function was important (the surrounding phonological environment and social factors were not significant). The implications for an understanding of pointing signs in signed languages are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of participant observation and social network analysis (SNA) were popularized in sociolinguistics by James and Lesley Milroy in the 1980s with their application of various measurements of network strength to data collected from three working class communities in Belfast. The technique was introduced as a method for studying sociolinguistic variation between individuals who were not discernible in terms of socio-economic class. Labov’s (2006 [1st edn. 1966]) model of language variation and change attempted to correlate linguistic variation with ‘global’ social categories such as social class, age and sex. Eckert (2005) describes studies which employ these methods as ‘first wave’. These studies typically show regular and replicable patterns of linguistic variation where often the use of vernacular variants strongly correlates with low socio-economic status. However, this approach is unable to explain the variation that continues to exist within larger social categories. Second wave studies (e.g. Rickford 1986; Milroy 1987a) employ ethnographic methods of data collection and SNA in an attempt to better understand the patterning of linguistic variation in a local context. Although highly innovative in the 1980s, the use of these techniques, especially SNA, has received heavy criticism (see e.g. Murray 1993). However, the techniques of SNA have advanced greatly in other disciplines and now incorporate more sophisticated mathematics (e.g. clique analyses based on graph theory) and more detailed methods of data collection. Dodsworth and Hume suggest that ‘linguists could construct more useful measures of network integration and investigate many more qualities (both quantitative and qualitative) of social network data’ (2005: 290). This chapter discusses one attempt to do just that. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

It is well known that native speakers of English around the globe are by far outnumbered today by speakers of English as a second or as a foreign language (Crystal, 2008). English is thus regularly used as a lingua franca, i.e. an intermediary language used between speakers of various linguistic backgrounds, for transnational and intercultural communication in many domains of life (such as business, diplomacy, higher education, tourism, etc.). The study of conditions of using 'English as a Lingua Franca' (ELF), intrinsically connected to the fields of World Englishes and Second Language Acquisition (Schneider, 2012), has come to be a booming sub-field and topic of research in English linguistics over the past few years, as is indicated by the publication of a few textbooks, the establishment of a conference series, and the launch of a scholarly journal (JELF). The focus of these approaches has been on the functions, usage conditions, and practical applications of ELF (Seidlhofer, 2011), and also, though to a lesser extent, on any characteristic structural properties (Dewey, 2007; Jenkins, Cogo & Dewey, 2011; Cogo & Dewey, 2012). Clearly, ELF can be found in a wide range of possible applications and contexts, as Cogo & Dewey (2012: 31) have stated: 'As a natural phenomenon of sociolinguistic variation, ELF includes all types of communicative events, from the transactional to the interactional, and various possible settings, such as the institutional and the casual.' It is considered to be independent of the interactants' native-speaker status: prototypically ELF involves communication between non-native speakers of English, but sometimes native speakers participate in such encounters as well. It centrally involves accommodation, negotiation and adjustment of forms to achieve successful communication. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

Research on attenuation has experienced a huge development in the last decades, particularly from some disciplines related to oral discourse, such as Pragmatics or Discourse Analysis. Nevertheless, its sociolinguistic variation has been hardly studied. This article aims to deep on the incidence that social parameters (age and sex) have on Spanish attenuating mechanisms and their discourse functions. The paper presents the quantitative results and findings obtained from 24 semi-controlled interviews taken from PRESEEA corpus, recorded both in Madrid and Valencia, amongst high sociocultural level speakers. This research is embedded in a specific project of PRESEEA Research Group (Proyecto para el Estudio Sociolingüístico del Español de España y América).

Building upon the foundation of variationist sociolinguistics and politeness theory, this paper examines the norms and patterns of compliment responses in Mandarin Chinese, and explores the constraints of sociolinguistic variables on the pragmatic variation of this speech act. This study is built on a corpus of 1,190 naturally occurring compliment exchanges collected in the speech community of Shanghai, in conjunction with the interlocutors' ethnographic information. Variable rule analysis is used to identify the factors that contribute to compliment response patterns. The most striking diachronic change revealed by this study lies in the fact that Chinese speakers considerably tend towards the acceptance of compliments while strategies of non-acceptance are on the decline, as exhibited by the Shanghai speech community. The study also suggests that Chinese speakers appear to be situated in a transitional period from the modesty maxim to the agreement maxim. In addition, the results demonstrated that the pragmatic variable of compliment response varies systematically with social variables such as gender, age, social status, education, social class, social distance, and the use of English. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The treatment of social meaning in sociolinguistic variation has come in three waves of analytic practice. The first wave of variation studies established broad correlations between linguistic variables and the macrosociological categories of socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, and age. The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.

There are two different ways of interpreting the socially correlated linguistic variation on the syntactic level. The first (Whiteman y Deutsch 1968), based on Bernstein's deficit hypothesis (Bernstein 1971), proposes that low class speakers show a poor level of language when compared with the high class speakers. The second view stems from the variationist paradigm (Labov 1965, 1966, 1972; Weinreich et al. 1968; Labov y Sankoff 1985) and considers this distinction as two different ways of expressing the same content. In this study, we compare the syntactic complexity in narratives of 60 high/low class adolescents with the same level of instruction. The narratives were segmented and analyzed using the T-unit proposal (Hunt 1970; Véliz 1988). The results indicate that-even though the high class speakers produce longer texts-there is no significant difference between the syntactic complexity of the two groups. Thus, the variationist view is supported, though it is still necessary to consider the effect of the level of instruction and the situational context of use.

The present study aims at analyzing the acquisition of dialect variation by native English-speaking university students who study Spanish for a semester in Spain. The selected variable is the phoneme /q/ (theta). The goal is to assess learner awareness, opinion, and use of [θ]. Data were elicited through a set of oral and written tasks conducted with 15 university students prior to, during, and after attending their study abroad program in Madrid. Although post-study abroad learners demonstrated high awareness of native speaker use of this dialect feature compared to pre-study abroad learners, this did not seem to determine their use of [θ]. Data suggested that (non) acquisition varies according to the dialect employed by the native speaker(s) with whom students are in contact before and after living abroad. © 2012 by American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.

This study quantitatively examines the variation of (ing) and (eng) in Taiwan, drawing data from sociolinguistic interviews with subjects from Taipei and Tainan. It argues that, first, the two should be treated as two separate variables rather than one with two phonological conditions, and second, language external factors, including speaker's place of origin, gender, current residence, and topic all influence the two variables, but to different extents. Place of origin has the strongest effect on the variation of (ing) and (eng), but the use of the merger variants of the two variables is respectively led by southerners and northerners, indicating a dialectal split. The merger variant [in] of (ing) is especially closely associated with regional identity. Gender also plays a substantial role in the variation of (ing), with males using the merger variant [in] significantly more than female subjects. In contrast, the relation between gender and (eng) appears more opaque, with Taipei females leading in the use of [an] and Tainan females using it least frequently among the 2 × 2 dyads of gender and region. The seemingly irregular pattern with regard to gender can be explained in light of Fon et al.'s (2011) perception test results and sociolinguistic literature related to gender and language variation. The study further provides a sketch of the development of the social meanings of the two variables in light of the findings of this study.

This article discusses how the study of metaphoric and more generally, figurative language use contributes to critical discourse analysis (CDA). It shows how cognitive linguists' recognition of metaphor as a fundamental means of concept- and argument-building can add to CDA's account of meaning constitution in the social context. It then discusses discrepancies between the early model of conceptual metaphor theory and empirical data and argues that discursive-pragmatic factors as well as sociolinguistic variation have to be taken into account in order to make cognitive analyses more empirically and socially relevant. In conclusion, we sketch a modified cognitive approach informed by Relevance Theory within CDA. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

This article makes a case for studying the perceptions that young people have of the ways of speaking of both themselves and others on the supposition that constructions of ambient sociolinguistic variation have an impact on the language development and use of individual language users. Such a study is particularly relevant in multilingual contexts in which differences with regard to social as well as ethnic and linguistic background may generate significantly different perceptions. In a speaker evaluation study, Swedish speech stimuli from 12 young Stockholmers were evaluated by 343 listeners from different backgrounds. The results show that young people may divide and relate to the linguistic space of Stockholm in very different ways and that they vary in their degree of accuracy regarding linguistic self-perception. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

The Implicit Association Test (IAT), designed to measure how strongly an individual implicitly aligns two dichotomies, such as male/female vs. home/career, is adapted in this study to analyze sociolinguistic variation. Three experiments test the IAT's ability to detect relationships between sociolinguistic variables and social categories and between related sociolinguistic variables. In Experiment 1, associations are shown between the English variable (ING) on the one hand and Northern/Southern states, blue collar/white collar professions and country singers/news anchors on the other, using written forms. In Experiment 2, associations are shown between audio tokens of (ING) and Northern/Southern states and between (ING) and /ay/ monophthongization, both tied to the ideologically well-defined Southern accent, but not between (ING) and /t/ release, which do not share an enregistered variety. Experiment 3 documents the lack of correlation between IAT measures and two more explicit measures of association: direct question and social evaluation. These results suggest that sociolinguists should take dual processing models of social cognition into account in considering the cognitive processing of socially loaded linguistic forms and that the IAT may be useful tool for the analysis of sociolinguistic meaning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The study reported in this article investigates the development of sociolinguistic competence among second-year (US university-level) L2 learners of French who were given systematic instruction on sociolinguistic variation as part of their normal coursework. We focus on the variable use of the negative morpheme ne in verbal negation. Drawing from learners' explanations of ne presence versus absence, their analyses of two texts representing different levels of discourse, and their own small-group inter-learner online chat discussions, we examine the link between conceptual understanding of variation in French and these learners' development of conscious control over variation. We show that properly organized pedagogical activity can help learners to develop their understanding of variable features of discourse, which ultimately leads (to) the development of their performance abilities. We present both quantitative and qualitative analyses of learners' performance to illustrate their developing control over variation in French, which begins to emerge as a sociolinguistic resource by the end of the academic term. © 2012 Oxford University Press.

Situated within the recent new wave of second language acquisition studies investigating the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation, this article draws on a longitudinal database of advanced French interlanguage to explore a number of issues that have not yet been extensively investigated. They concern the issue of individual variation in the use of sociolinguistic variables, the issue of the relationship between the use of different sociolinguistic variables within the individual learner's sociolinguistic repertoire, and the issue of the long-term impact of naturalistic exposure on the instructed learner's sociolinguistic development. Quantitative results provide a close-up picture of the advanced learner's sociolinguistic profile, the detail of which calls into question a number of previously accepted findings, such as the traditional ideas that classroom learners make minimal use, if any, of informal sociolinguistic variants and that even with naturalistic exposure, they continue to underuse such variants relative to the native speaker. Our results demonstrate the value of focusing on the individual learner, as opposed to the traditional approach of providing group results. Our findings further underline the need to compare use of different variable types by the individual learner in order to illuminate how use of a specific variable relates to others. © 2012 The Modern Language Journal.

I present a new model for bilingual minds in sociolinguistic variation situations, proposing and incorporating a set of social constraints into Optimality Theory and the Gradual Learning Algorithm. Incorporating social constraints with linguistic constrains is essential to provide explanation of the grammar differences among speakers belonging to the same or different social groups. The naturally occurring speech of fifty-two migrant rural speakers of Colloquial Arabic to the city of Hims in Syria comprises the data set. The intra- and inter-speaker variation in the use of [q] and [?] is used to demonstrate the working mechanism of the model that gives a mental representation of what occurs in a varying speaker's mind in a certain sociolinguistic setting. The shift to the use of the urban prestigious form, [?], in the city indicates that social constraints are variable and setting-relative. The difference in the ranking values of social constraints among speakers influence the speakers' variable percentages of [q] and [?]. Manipulating the output percentages from which speakers learn gives the specific sociolinguistic grammar of each speaker or group of speakers and their output percentages that match real life occurrences. Consequently, the model reflects on the social networks of speakers because the degree of input of a form affects the degree of acquisition of that form. Among the many advantages of this new model is giving expectation on what the speech of a speaker will sound like if certain social constraints are involved. Most importantly, this model unifies the linguistic and social aspects of language in one theoretical framework. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Long before linguists have focused on the role language plays in the position of women in society, they had studied and are still studying the presence of lexical, phonological, and morphological forms that are used only or predominantly by speakers of one sex or the other. Now linguists are interested in sociolinguistic variation: men's and women's speech is investigated along with social status, style, age, and ethnicity. Studies of linguistic variation related to sex in some Arab, American, and British communities reveal the fact that women are more conservative than men in their tendency to standard linguistic forms. Women are sensitive to linguistic variants that are socially stigmatized; therefore, they consistently produce forms which approach those of the standard language. And because women feel socially insecure, they are more status conscious than men are in the equivalent social roles. It follows from this that women tend more than men to use the forms of language that carry higher status connotations. In this paper, the author will attempt to investigate the hypothesis that the same holds true for sex-linked variation not only in highly sophisticated countries but also in still developing and non-developing communities which have been studied. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER Manufactured in Finland.

This article explores the microgenetic development of learners' understanding of sociolinguistic variation in French during an instructional conversation (IC) that followed a language analysis task in which learners attempted to formulate hypotheses about the nature of language variation. During the IC, the instructor led students toward a conceptual understanding of variation in French by providing appropriate graduated (i.e. from implicit or strategic to explicit) mediation that was sensitive to the class's zone of proximal development (ZPD). Teacher-student collaborative interaction within a group's ZPD has the potential to develop learners' conceptual understanding of variation, which can provide an important orienting basis for the development of their performance abilities. The transcript of the IC is analysed and discussed with regard to the amount and type(s) of mediation the instructor provides and opportunities for development created in this type of collaborative interaction. © The Author(s) 2012.

In her landmark paper Age as a Sociolinguistic Variable, Eckert states that "age is a person's place at a given time in relation to the social order: a stage, a condition, a place in history" (1997:151). Speaker age has long been one of the primary social categories within sociolinguistics, and may be argued to be the sociolinguistic category. Indeed, many of our theories about how language varies and what becomes of that variation are built upon notions of how speaker age relates to and reflects language use, including age-related cut-offs for the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation (Payne [1980]Locating language in time and space, New York: Academic Press), the apparent time hypothesis of language change (Bailey et al. [1991]Language Variation and Change, 3, 241-64), and the relationship of age to linguistic style (Bakht [2010]Lexical Variation and the Negotiation of Linguistic Style in a Long Island Middle School. New York University). However, as Eckert points out, we often do not go deeply enough into the theoretical background that such uses of age entail and that "the study of age as a sociolinguistic variable... requires that we focus on the nature and social status of age and aging" (Eckert [1997]The handbook of sociolinguistics. Oxford: Blackwell:152). Over the course of the last few decades, however, the nature of age has changed significantly for one specific group, that of emerging adults (Arnett [2004]Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties. Oxford: Oxford University Press). The theory of "emerging adulthood," as developed by Arnett over the last decade (i.e., Arnett [2000]American Psychologist 55(5), 469-80; Arnett [2004]; Arnett [2007]Childhood Development Perspectives 1(2), 68-73; Arnett et al. [2011]Debating emerging adulthood: Stage or process? Oxford: Oxford University Press), is a "new and historically unprecedented period of the life course" (2004:4) that has only recently arisen within "industrialized or 'postindustrial' countries" (2004:21) and, therefore, could only have been experienced as a specific life-stage by those individuals born after 1975 or so. In broad terms, emerging adults are those individuals in industrialized societies who exist in a transitional period between the parental care and stability experienced during adolescence and the self-sufficiency and stability experienced during adulthood. Though typically made up of individuals aged 18-25, emerging adulthood can span a number of years on either side, encompassing for some a period of life stretching into the mid-thirties, or for others, a short period of only one to 2years after leaving secondary school. The emerging adulthood stage is composed of individuals who have not yet settled into the long-term choices and life-paths that make up adulthood. Emerging adults often are university students, are highly mobile, engage in large but not necessarily dense social networks, and are generally unmarried (or, perhaps, not in the long-term marriages that are associated with adulthood). If we accept Arnett's theory that emerging adulthood is a distinct and relatively new psychological-developmental period, then we must recognize that these people, "trying out different experiences and gradually making their way toward enduring choices" (Arnett 2007), also represent a new kind of sociolinguistic actor - an age group that may at once challenge and provide a rich proofing ground for our theories on sociolinguistic identity, variation, and change. In this paper, I describe why the theory of "emerging adulthood" should be incorporated into studies of sociolinguistic variation, describing how some of the basic concepts of sociolinguistic theory may need to be reconsidered in light of this new stage of the life course. I begin by providing background on "emerging adulthood" and the characteristics of "emerging adults" as developed by Arnett and others, focusing on the argument that emerging adulthood is not simply a new way of marking an age-group, but an entirely new developmental stage. Next, I show how emerging adulthood relates to the sociolinguistic concepts of "place" and "network", arguing that the societal shifts that have brought about emerging adulthood have likewise changed the assumptions of permanence, intimacy, and physical geography that these concepts are built upon. The social categories of "class" and "gender" are then discussed, highlighting how the understanding of these terms among emerging adults is neither predictable nor necessarily consistent across individuals. Especially difficult when discussing the sociolinguistics of class is the intersection of advantage and age that emerging adulthood seems to entail. Finally, I argue that because the characteristic features of emerging adulthood - exploration, instability, and change chief among them - are shared by sociolinguistic innovators, current and future sociolinguistic studies would do well to attend to the theory of emerging adulthood. This is especially true of studies regarding language change and the sociolinguistic leaders of variation. Examples throughout are drawn from my own work with university students in Illinois from 2005 to 2007 (Bigham [2008]Dialect contact and accommodation among emerging adults in a university setting. University of Texas at Austin). My stance in this paper is one of support and full recognition for the validity of the theory of emerging adulthood; for further reading on the debate surrounding emerging adulthood overall, the reader is referred to Arnett et al. 2011. © 2012 The Author.

Immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries bring their varieties of Spanish to the US and contribute to the ongoing development of those varieties in the new setting. In this paper, the variation of syllable final (r) is investigated in a group of Cuban immigrants in Miami. It reports on the linguistic and social factors that constrain variation of four variants (retention, assimilation, lateralization, and aspiration), particularly their generational and social distributions, with the goal of examining factors that contribute to negative perceptions of the island variety among Cubans in Miami (Alfaraz 2002). The findings indicated that the variants of (r) are constrained by a combination of linguistic and social factors, with following phonetic context having the strongest influence on retention, lateralization, and aspiration, but not on assimilation, on which generation had the strongest influence. For the four variants, generational differences were found: the older generation favored retention and aspiration, whereas the younger one favored assimilation and lateralization. The role of this distribution in shaping evaluations of the island variety is discussed. © 2012, Equinox Publishing.

Current 'Speaker Design' approaches to sociolinguistic variation investigate how speakers may pro-actively deploy the linguistic resources (variation) at their disposal to achieve certain communicative effects. In this paper, Speaker Design is investigated in the case of Southern American English, a regional variety that can reportedly be used specifically by women to project personal charm. An interactional as well as a cognitive sociolinguistic account of this process are provided. Furthermore, empirical evidence for its workings is presented. This evidence is derived from a speaker evaluation experiment, whose results are outlined. It is argued that this experiment demonstrates that Southern American English elicits certain social associations in listeners such that women using it sound socially attractive. Female Southern speakers can tap into this effect to contextualize their utterances accordingly, giving rise to communicative effects such as 'charming' customers into buying products.

It is a well known fact that people who belong to a particular linguistic community do not speak at a similar way. In this sense, different studies have considered a lot of differences, for which reason, they look for its origin in differents factors: social characteristics of the speaker (like being man or woman, young or adult, and so forth), social characteristics of the interlocutors (for example, to have more or less status that the speaker), the geographic enviroment in which the interaction is developed, and so on. Whithin this framework, this investigation tries to analyze the differences and similarities of phraseological type that exist in the form of speaking of two distinctive social groups of the Fifth Region of Chile. For that reason, two groups of secondary school, one of them belonging to a municipal institution and the other one to a state-subsidiezed institution, were respectively compared. Consequently, a level of sociolinguistic variation is proposed that, apparently, it has not attracted too mucsh attention: the level of phraseological variation.

In this paper we want to research the sociolinguistic variation among people speaking dialect. The research has been made in two villages, in Aramaio and in Otxandio. This is a small sample of a wider project carried out by the research team EUDIA of the University of the Basque Country. The name of the project is EAS (Euskararen Atlas sozio-geolinguistikoa or Socio-and geo-linguistic atlas of the Basque language). In this project an enquiry is carried out in 100 villages of the Basque speaking area (in the seven provinces). The questionnaire has about 200 questions (which cover different fields of the language: lexicon, noun morphology, verb morphology and syntax). The questionnaire is done in each village and the respondents are two male speakers, one of them young and the other mature. We want to know what the linguistic differentiations are (in lexicon, in morphology and in syntax) between young and middle aged people. Moreover, we have paid special attention to measure the influence of Unified Basque. ©Universitat de Barcelona.

Acoustic and auditive observations are reported for Slovak consonants l (in non-syllabic position not followed by e, i, í in spelling) and l (orthographically represented by the letter l), for which the IPA uses the symbols /l/ and /λ/. The laterals were produced by 20 news-readers of Rádio Slovensko and by V. Záborský (a traditional model of good pronunciation), and analyzed in terms of two indicators of softness (clarity)/hardness (darkness, velarization): F2-F1 and F1/F2. Acoustic and auditive analyses revealed that the majority of the selected indicators are suited for the leveling (normalization) of gender differences in the production of l and l. Individual genders can therefore be analyzed jointly. It has further been determined that there are significant differences in the realization of l and l in the speech of individual speakers, and at least two types of l and l can be identified in the selected sample. Normalization by means of the modified Lobanov z-score transformation makes the samples of the individual speakers so homogeneous, that not only physiological, but also sociolinguistic variation disappears. Finally, the comparison of the laterals in the speech of news-readers and V. Záborský showed no significant differences in the production of l and l.

I present a new model for analyzing sociolinguistic variation, proposing and incorporating a set of social constraints into Optimality Theory and the Gradual Learning Algorithm. Incorporating social constraints with linguistic constrains is essential to provide explanation of the grammar differences among speakers belonging to the same or different social groups. The naturally occurring speech of fifty-two migrant rural speakers of Colloquial Arabic to the city of Hims in Syria comprises the data set. The intra-and inter-speaker variation in the use of [q] and [?] is used to demonstrate the working mechanism of the model that gives a mental representation of what occurs in a varying speaker's mind in a certain sociolinguistic setting. The shift to the use of the urban prestigious form, [?], in the city indicates that social constraints are variable and setting-relative. The difference in the ranking values of social constraints among speakers influence the speakers' variable percentages of [q] and [?]. Manipulating the output percentages from which speakers learn gives the specific sociolinguistic grammar of each speaker or group of speakers and their output percentages that match real life occurrences. Consequently, the model reflects on the social networks of speakers because the degree of input of a form affects the degree of acquisition of that form. Among the many advantages of this new model is giving expectation on what the speech of a speaker will sound like if certain social constraints are involved. Most importantly, this model unifies the linguistic and social aspects of language in one theoretical framework. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this paper it is argued that the variation between local and supradialectal grammatical features in birchbark letter no. 907 from Novgorod is not accidental, but sociolinguistically motivated from a communicative point of view. In addition, other birchbark documents are discussed-in particular nos. 23 and 755 from Novgorod-which may reveal similar sociolinguistic awareness on the part of the scribes. © 2011 The Author(s).

This paper explores the linguistic and social factors behind the acquisition of glottal variation in English /t/ by native Polish speakers living in Manchester, UK. It investigates the speech of 40 Polish adults of varying levels of English language proficiency, who have been in Manchester for varying lengths of time, in order to establish what might be encouraging or prohibiting the acquisition of this widespread linguistic feature. Using quantitative sociolinguistic methods, factors such as level of English, length of residence, age, gender, motivation and attitude are considered in accounting for the variation in acquisition. Findings suggest that in addition to level of English and length of residence effects there is a fairly robust gender difference, with women tending to use glottal variants more frequently than men. This gender difference is explored in more detail with reference to a gender as practice type approach. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This paper investigates the perceptual aspect of quantitative sociolinguistic variation in order to derive properties of a sociolinguistic monitor integrated into linguistic processing in real time. A series of experiments measured listeners' sensitivity to frequencies in the form of variable percentages of the non-standard apical form of the variable (ING). Subjects heard ten trial readings of broadcast news from the same speaker, and rated them on a seven-point Likert scale of professional suitability. Responses conformed closely to a logarithmic function in which the effect of each deviation from the norm was proportional to the percent increase in deviations. The logarithmic pattern of responses was replicated in group and individual experiments in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in group experiments in Columbia, South Carolina and Durham, New Hampshire. South Carolina subjects were less critical of the /in/ variant in news broadcasting but showed the identical logarithmic function in reacting to Northern and Southern speakers. Inferences are drawn on the window of temporal resolution of the sociolinguistic monitor, its sensitivity and the pattern of attenuation over time. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011.

Forensic linguistics is an integral part of applied linguistics. Those who do this work analyze statutes, legal procedures, courtroom language, and language used as evidence in criminal and civil court cases. One major difference from other types of applied linguistics is that there is no need to gather data because it is already provided. This means that the linguist has to work with data that already exists, using the major tools of linguistics, including phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistic variation, discourse analysis, language change, stylistics, lexicography, and graphemics. As in all applied linguistics, forensic linguists begin with the perspective of the legal context and audience and apply the appropriate linguistic tools to the legal issues. Linguists who testify at trials first have to meet certain legal standards in order to be accepted as experts. Throughout the process, the forensic linguist, like any applied linguist, has to teach lawyers, judges, and jurors the way linguistic analysis works in relation to the specific legal issues. The recent growth of forensic linguistics is a hopeful sign of the expansion of applied linguistics beyond its conventional focus on language learning, teaching and testing. © 2011 Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

This article explores sociolinguistic variation in the use of French accents and diacritics - where they would be expected in the formal written language - in electronic personals posted on an Internet dating site. Results of a series of VARBRUL analyses show both age (i.e., 18-25 years vs. 36-45 years) and gender to be significant social variables in accent/diacritic variation. Three potential explanations of the variation are addressed: (i) the eventual loss of accents and diacritics in computer-mediated French, (ii) stable variation with differences between 'digital natives' and 'digital immigrants', and (iii) a change in progress whereby accents and diacritics are becoming 'prestige variants' in computer-mediated contexts. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2010.

Although New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) is used by a closely networked national Deaf community, it exhibits considerable variation in the lexicon that has been anecdotally and empirically attributed to age and region. This article reports a quantitative study that examined the effects of age, region, gender, and ethnicity on variation in eighty target vocabulary items, across 138 Deaf NZSL users. The dataset consisted of 11,040 tokens, in which 249 distinct variants for the 80 items were identified. Findings confirmed that age group is the strongest social correlate of lexical variation. Marked diachronic variation and change, shown by the "apparent-time" method of comparing age groups, reflects the impact of the adoption of Australasian Signed English in deaf education from 1979 in replacing and supplementing the earlier lexicon. A strong leveling effect found in the lexicon of younger signers is also attributable to their use of this sign system in education. Some regional effects found, and a pattern of interaction between region and age group - with southern and older signers tending to conserve early variants. Gender and ethnicity played a minimal role in explaining variation in this analysis. Given the salience of gender and ethnicity in sociolinguistic variation studies generally, this finding may be explained by the particular socio-historical profile of the NZSL community, or by the likelihood that these identity characteristics are indexed by sub-lexical features, and/or by the decontextualized data elicitation method, which may not capture the potential use of lexical variants that respond to audience, topic and style considerations in discourse contexts. © 2010 Project MUSE®.

Spatial representations of time are a ubiquitous feature of human cognition. Nevertheless, interesting sociolinguistic variations exist with respect to where in space people locate temporal constructs. For instance, while in English time metaphorically flows horizontally, in Mandarin an additional vertical dimension is employed. Noting that the bilingual mind can flexibly accommodate multiple representations, the present work explored whetherMandarin-English bilinguals possess two mental time lines. Across two experiments, we demonstrated that Mandarin-English bilinguals do indeed employ both horizontal and vertical representations of time. Importantly, subtle variations to cultural context were seen to shape how these time lines were deployed. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2011.

Situated within the sociolinguistic study of intra-speaker variation, this article reports a 'speech perception elicitation test' aimed at eliciting on which linguistic basis Austrian listeners perceive style-shifts between standard Austrian German and Austrian dialect. Forty-two informants were asked to listen to twelve audio-excerpts from an Austrian TV discussion and to underline in standard transcripts any passages in which they heard dialectal speech being used, as opposed to standard. The outcome is a set of linguistic features that appear to be consensually used by Austrians as dialect 'diagnostics', and hence can be maintained to evoke this style when used in conversation. It is argued that establishing such a set of features on an empirical basis meets an important requirement for any claims about effects created via style-shifting in interaction (such as participant alignments), because such claims are predicated on the assumption that a respective shift be identified by listeners in inferencing meaning. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011.

Based on a large-scale survey, this paper argues that the speech of American Jews should be analyzed not as a separate ethnolect or language variety but as English with a repertoire of distinctive linguistic features stemming from Yiddish, Hebrew, Aramaic, and other sources. Jews make selective use of this repertoire as they index their identities as Jews and as certain types of Jews. Older Jews, Orthodox Jews, and non-Orthodox Jews who are highly engaged in religious life use different Hebrew and Yiddish words and grammatical constructions and different Hebrew pronunciations. Some Jews use distinctive meanings of Yiddish words, regional pronunciations of English words, or discourse styles. These trends are analyzed in relation to ethnolinguistic variation and Jewish languages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous studies conducted in both the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic fields have established that the parents' socio-economic status (SES) influences several aspects of children's language production. Moreover, a number of psycholinguistic studies strongly suggest that these differences are due in part to differences in the nature and the quantity of input that children are exposed to. Despite these advances, in our knowledge, the developmental dynamic of the differences still has to be described and explained. The aim of the current study is to examine this dynamic in the production of liaison, a phonological alternation in French which is, in some cases, obligatory and used in a uniform manner by adults and, in others, a sociolinguistic variable whose frequency of use depends on the speaker's SES. One hundred and eighty-five children aged from 2;3 to 6;0 belonging to two distinct SES groups (higher- and lower-SES) and subdivided into four age-groups participated in a picture naming task eliciting the production of obligatory and variable liaisons. First, an analysis of the three types of child production (correct liaison, omission, replacement) confirms that the linguistic forms which are present in the input increase with age in children's productions, whereas those which are absent tend to disappear. Second, the evolution of the SES-related differences depends on the uniformity or heterogeneity of usage in the social groups: convergence for obligatory liaison and divergence for variable liaison. The discussion of these findings combines both psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives since both have stressed the importance of exposure to linguistic forms in the input. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One purpose of this paper is discovering the socioeconomic indicators that determine social class identification in Arabic-speaking Communities. Another purpose is investigating whether those socioeconomic indicators have the same influence as social class on linguistic variation. The study focuses on a community of fifty-two Christian rural migrant speakers to the City of Hims in Syria. They display variation in their use of the rural form, [q], and the corresponding urban prestigious form, [?]. The community's general assignment of social class is tested against four socioeconomic indicators: income, education, occupation, and residential area. The statistical analysis shows stronger as- sociation between social class and income and residential area; weaker association with occupation; and no association with education. Among the socioeconomic indicators that showed association with social class, only income and occupation exhibited similar results to social class (i.e., emerged statistically insignificant regarding the variable use of both [q] and [?]). Residential area showed different results. Unlike social class and like education that is not associated with social class, it emerged as statistically significant regarding the variable use of [?] and statistically insignificant regarding the variable use of [q]. © 2010 equinox publishing.

The chapter aims to observe sociolinguistic aspects of SMS with a view to identifying gender boundaries. Ever growing text-based communication through mobile phone triggers an important question: Do we need to review the parameters - phonological variations, stylistic range e.g. discourse analysis and conversational interaction - for gender identification? Having suggested a new parameter to gender identification, the study draws on: (a) SMS varieties between female to female, male to male, male to female texter (b) SMS varieties to identify gender variations, and (c) the sociolinguistics of SMS for gender identification. A corpus of over 300 SMS messages was collected from students of different age groups spread over educational institutions in Pakistan. The data were enlisted under five variables: compressions, abbreviations, symbols, tenses and punctuation to investigate variations among male and female texters on the former variables. Two more factors, use of mother tongue and second language, were also analyzed to address the research questions (a-c). The data analysis reveals that SMS texting identifies gender boundaries and the evolution of some sociolinguistic variations among the texters. © 2010, IGI Global.

This article investigates the indexical relation between language, interactional stance and social class. Quantitative sociolinguistic analysis of a linguistic variable (the first person possessive singular) is combined with interactional analysis of the way one particular variant (possessive 'me', as in Me pencil's up me jumper) is used by speakers in 'stylised' interactional performances. The aim of this analysis is to explore: (1) how possessive 'me' is implicated in the construction and management of local identities and relationships; and (2) how macro-social categories, such as social class, relate to linguistic choice. The data for this analysis comes from an ethnographic study of the language practices of nine- to ten-year-old children in two socially-differentiated primary schools in north-east England. A secondary aim of the article is to spotlight the sociolinguistic sophistication of these young children, in particular, the working-class participants, who challenge the notion that the speech of working-class children is in any way 'impoverished'. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2010.

We suggest that construction-based theories of language structure and change offer a particularly useful framework for understanding variation and grammaticalization in signed languages. We show that there is a complementary dimension to sociolinguistic variation in signed languages that is only now opening up to systematic investigation through the use of large machine-readable corpora : namely, the frequency and environments of use of particular variants as a manifestation of on-going lexicalization and grammaticalization. This promises to increase our knowledge about the sociolinguistics of signed languages, as well as broaden our understanding of variation in language generally. Specifically, it promises to yield evidence from signed languages on the extent of grammaticalization in these relatively young languages, on the one hand, and the unique gestural and lexical grammaticalization pathways preferentially exploited by face-to-face visual-gestural languages, on the other. We begin by summarizing the findings from research on sociolinguistic variation in signed languages that show how variation is often not random, but is conditioned by social and linguistic factors. We then introduce relevant concepts of construction grammar and show how they may be applied to sign structure to illuminate what is meant by lexicalization in signed languages, and, by extension, how this relates to potential grammaticalization pathways in these languages. We conclude that while there is always variation in language, and variation may function as an index of social variables, some variation may actually reflect on-going language change, in particular lexicalization and grammaticalization.

This article investigates the productive use of ne in a 100,000 word corpus of online Montreal French chat discourse. It compares (i) rates of ne use in the present article with those previously reported for other French-language online communities as well as spoken Canadian French and (ii) the discursive-pragmatic function of productive ne in the online Montreal French chat community. The results show that ne is used productively less frequently in Montreal French chat than in other (European) French-language chat communities. At the same time, rates of ne use in the online Montreal speech community are higher than reported in previous studies of spoken Canadian French. Following the presentation of selected descriptive statistics, a qualitative analysis is presented in order to show how emphatic ne is jointly constructed in multiparty interactions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With Chinese native-speaker data as the baseline, this study investigates the use of the morphosyntactic particle DE by learners of Chinese as a second language. The general patterns are as follows: (a) DE tends to be deleted more in informal speech than in formal settings; (b) higher proficiency and longer residence in China-more interactions with native speakers-promote DE deletion; and (c) females tend to adopt more formal language style and use DE more than males. The study also found that teachers and textbooks use DE much more often than native speakers. Learners' patterns of DE use closely follow those of their teachers and textbooks, suggesting the necessity of explicit instruction in sociolinguistic variants in L2 classrooms. © 2010 Language Learning Research Club, University of Michigan.

Language in use is central to both sociolinguistics and Cognitive Linguistics (CL). But despite the claim that CL is a usage-based model of language structure, attempts have only recently been made to synthesise aspects of CL and sociolinguistics (see, for example, the collection of papers in Kristiansen and Dirven 2008), and generally the treatment of this synthesis has been weak on empirical detail. Using techniques typical of modern (variationist) sociolinguistic data collection and analysis, we examine a phonological change in progress (TH-Fronting) in East-Central Scotland. We incorporate both 'social' and 'cognitive' factors in our analysis of this phonological change and suggest that such a unified approach not only provides a more parsimonious theory of language, but also enables us to account more comprehensively for the variability associated with this sound change. The outcome of such a synthesis is therefore beneficial to researchers in both sociolinguistics and Cognitive Linguistics. © 2010 Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin/New York.

In this chapter, we will examine the historical relationship between signed languages used in the United Kingdom (British Sign Language, or BSL), Australia (Australian Sign Language, or Auslan) and New Zealand (New Zealand Sign Language, or NZSL), as well as work on sociolinguistic variation and language change in all three sign language varieties. Following Johnston (2003), we will adopt the acronym BANZSL here (i.e., British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language) to refer to all three signed languages as a group. We will begin by outlining the history of BSL and its transmission to the former British colonies of Australia and New Zealand, before discussing studies that have compared similarities in the lexicon of BSL, Auslan and NZSL. We will then explore the relationship between phonological, lexical and syntactic variation and change in these three related languages and social factors such as a signer’s regional origin, age and gender. The deaf communities in the UK, Australia and New Zealand The prevalence of deafness in developed societies has long been estimated to be about 0.1 percent of the population (i.e., one in one thousand people) (Schein 1968, Schein & Delk 1974). If this were the case, one would expect the deaf communities of the UK, Australia and New Zealand to number 60,000, 20,000 and 4,000 individuals respectively, based on the national populations of each country. The precise number of signing deaf people in all three countries is, however, unknown. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

The analysis in the present study examines the variable use of ne in 2,459 tokens of verbal negation from a corpus of electronic French discourse including moderated chat, non-moderated chat, and discussion fora. These data from computer-mediated communication (CMC) environments were analyzed in order to demonstrate that although both non-moderated and moderated chat are essentially synchronous (i.e. involving real-time interaction), they are on opposite ends of a continuum of French sociolinguistic variation. In non-moderated chat, which is clearly less formal, ne is used productively as a discursivepragmatic marker. However, in moderated chat, which resembles more formal written French discourse, ne deletion rarely occurs. Although discussion fora are somewhere between the two types of chat on the continuum of sociolinguistic variation, there is a clear tendency for them to be slightly closer to the formal/written side, yet this mode of CMC displays the greatest amount of mode-internal variation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This article explores the concept of indeterminacy as a fundamental property of social life (Falk-Moore 1978) as it relates to key issues in sociolinguistic theory: the relationship between structure and agency and the way that linguistic signs are invested with social meanings. Indeterminacy emerges as a fundamental principle of sociolinguistic variables, context, speaker identity and participation structures, as a resource for speakers and as a possible objective of communicative practice. It stands in constant tension with processes of sociolinguistic regularization, as it is instantiated across texts, time and discourses and as it is embedded in particular social and political fields. The article argues that studying this tension is how a contemporary sociolinguistics can approach a coherent account of agency and constraint, change and continuity, reproduction and contestation of normative practices and dominant language ideologies. © 2009, equinox publishing.

Sociolinguistic variation in Austria and the German-speaking part of Switzerland has traditionally been described in very different terms. In Austria, the linguistic range between the standard language and the local dialects has been referred to as a 'standard-dialectcontinuum', whereas the German-speaking part of Switzerland has often been cited as the typical example of a 'diglossic' language community. The sociolinguistic situation in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, which is part of a primarily Bavarian-speaking country but also of the Alemannic dialect region, has not been thoroughly examined in any studies up to date.

This study draws upon Strauss' (2004) model of cultural standing to analyze opinions regarding Fidel Castro and US-Cuba relations among three major groups of Miami Cubans, identified according to their time of immigration: early 1960s exiles, "Marielitos" and their children (1980 exiles), and the younger generation (Miami-born grandchildren of 1960s exiles). I argue that the discourse features used to convey differing ideological stances on sending aid to Cuba or visiting the Island are reflective of two rather distinct "opinion communities" in Cuban Miami. To that end, I explore the relationship between processes of simplification in the Spanish verb system and the discourse features of cultural standing by focusing on members of the younger generation, who generally perpetuate the exile discourse of their grandparents. The possibility of returning permanently to a post-Castro Cuban homeland is also analyzed through the lens of the discourse of common opinion.

Nonlinguists prove surprisingly good at recognizing dialects, even as dialects rapidly evolve. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's speech was intensely discussed among linguists, the media, and laypeople. Though Palin is from Alaska, her speech was often identified with the Upper Midwest.The authors explore what this mismatch can tell us about dialects and their perception, starting from a description of Palin's speech as commented on in the media.They review some pragmatic features and provide quantitative treatment of her "g-dropping." Then, they undertake acoustic analysis of Palin's vowels and final /z/ devoicing, including Western features and features that create an impression of her speech as Upper Midwestern. Regional settlement history, research on "new dialect formation," and research on perception of variation inform the authors' finding that a few acoustic and other characteristics trigger a specific national perception of Palin's verbal behavior. © The Author(s) 2009.

There have been countless speculations about the phenomenon of languages changing in time from generation to generation. As the age difference between generations increases, changes in the language passed down from the older generation to the younger become much more noticeable. Over time, Cypriot Turkish (i.e., the variety of Turkish used by the Turkish Cypriot community in Northern Cyprus) has been exposed to a variety of internal and external changes through contact with Standard Turkish. The main purpose of this article is to explore the intergenerational phonological shift over apparent time in the city of Famagusta in Northern Cyprus. The focus is on the competition between the traditional non-standard Turkish Cypriot voiced obstruent stop variants [g], [d], and [b] and the Standard Turkish voiceless variants [k], [t], and [p]. The results show sociolinguistic variation depending on age and gender, and point to the possibility of a long-term decline in Cypriot Turkish in favor of Standard Turkish. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

This paper argues that a group of white residents on the Lower East Side of Manhattan use a New York City English (NYCE) feature - non-rhoticity in the syllable coda - in the construction of a place identity, one aspect of identity tied to localness and authenticity. A quantitative analysis confirms that the change in progress towards rhoticity in NYCE (Labov 1966) continues to advance slowly, so that non-rhoticity remains a resource for New Yorkers, imbued with local social meaning. Ethnographic observation of the Lower East Side reveals conflict among residents, which motivates one group to highlight their place identity by using non-rhoticity. These Lower East Siders utilize micro-variation of /r/ in stretches of interview talk, increasing non-rhoticity when discussing neighborhood topics. Results support a social practice approach to stylistic and sociolinguistic variation, where Lower East Siders use /r/ in constructing a place identity in order to present themselves as authentic neighborhood residents. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2009.

This chapter explores the relationship between stance and sociolinguistic style. It argues that stance is the basis of style in sociolinguistic variation: sociolinguistic variants are initially associated with interactional stances, and these stances become reified in a speech community over time and repeated use. The chapter thus evaluates the possibility that stance is the main explanation for patterns of sociolinguistic variation, such that any choice of linguistic form made by speakers is made ultimately because of the interpersonal or epistemic stances they wish to take with their various interlocutors, the content of their talk, and nonpresent1 others. The chapter argues that these stance indexicalities become "short-circuited," so that ways of speaking become associated with situations and speaking roles in which certain stances are customarily taken. Styles of speaking are thus shorthand for bundles of habitually taken stances. The chapter thus connects the everyday use of language variation in discourse to the ways that it patterns on larger social scales, and to test the hypothesis that this connection can be made through the concept of stance. After a short discussion of the concepts of style, stance, and indexicality, the chapter demonstrates the importance of stance in variation patterns through three examples. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

Whether some languages or dialects are spoken faster or slower than others constitutes a gap in the understanding of sociolinguistic variation. Speech tempo is interconnected with the social, physical and psychological marking of speech. This study examines regional variation in articulation rate and its manifestations across speaker age, gender, and speaking situations (reading vs. informal talk). The results of an experimental investigation show that articulation rate differs significantly between two regional varieties of American English examined here. A group of Northern speakers (from Wisconsin) spoke significantly faster than a group of Southern speakers (from North Carolina). With regard to age and gender, young adults read faster than older adults in both regions; in informal talks, however, only Northern young adults spoke faster than older adults. Effects of gender were smaller and less consistent; men generally spoke slightly faster than women did. As the body of work on the sociophonetics of American English continues to grow in scope and depth, we argue that it is important to include fundamental phonetic information as part of our catalog of regional differences and patterns of change in American English. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

Drawing mainly on the ethnographical approach to the study of language in society, this study examines gender as a social factor in the variable use of subject-verb gender agreement (G-Agr, for short) rule in Nepali. Gender in this study is viewed as a socio-culturally constructed concept, following Eckert (1989, 1990, 1991, 2000) and Eckert and McConnell-Ginet (1992). This study argues that Nepali speakers' language behavior as evident in the variable use of G-Agr rule is the sociolinguistic reflection of the variability in their adoption of the progressive perception of women and their social standing in Nepali society. The study finds female speakers leading male speakers and young speakers leading adult speakers in dropping the G-Agr rule and thus in the use of nonstandard language in conversational interaction. Their lead in the use of nonstandard language forms is meaningful within the changing socio-cultural context of Nepali society. The study indicates that the G-Agr rule may have lost its obligatory status and that Nepali may be moving towards becoming a gender-neutral language. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article reports on the variable omission of the French negative particle ne (the first marker of verbal negation) in synchronous (i.e., real-time) electronic communication environments. Patterns of variation in a corpus of non-educational chat (i.e., free, public-access Internet chat) are analyzed and compared to data produced by first-, second-, and third-year American university students of French in an educational setting. First- and second-year students retained ne nearly categorically; third-year students used ne five times more often than participants in the non-educational context. Considerable inter-individual variation was observed in the third-year student data, although only one student exhibited native-like patterns of variation. The results are discussed within the broader context of teaching and learning sociolinguistic variation in French as a second or foreign language, with a specific focus on using authentic electronic discourse as one way of sensitizing students to sociolinguistic variation. © 2009 The Canadian Modern Language Review/La Revue canadienne des langues vivantes,.

Modeling socioeconomic class has been a persistent challenge in the analysis of sociolinguistic variation. While early stratificational models formulated on the basis of socioeconomic indicators such as income, occupation, and area of residence revealed compelling patterns of linguistic variation, they were critiqued for their lack of explanatory power at the interactional level and for their marginalization of those without paid employment. Subsequent models have employed crossdisciplinary concepts such as the linguistic market, social networks, and communities of practice, prioritizing local social distinctions that are understood to reflect or even constitute abstract structural categories such as 'working class' or 'middle class'. It is argued that a full socioeconomic class paradigm for sociolinguistics would also theorize class at the aggregate level, and to this end, sociological class models may prove useful. Contemporary sociological class analysis at the level of social practice offers additional avenues for interfacing with sociology. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this book H.D. Adamson reviews scholarship in sociolinguistics and second language acquisition, comparing theories of variation in first and second-language speech, with special attention to the psychological underpinnings of variation theory. Interlanguage is what second language learners speak. It contains syntactic, morphological and phonological patterns that are not those of either the first or the second language, and which can be analyzed using the principles and techniques of variation theory. Interlanguage Variation in Theoretical and Pedagogical Perspective: relates the emerging field of variation in second language learners' speech (interlanguage) to the established field of variation in native speakers' speech relates the theory of linguistic variation with psycholinguistic models of language processing relates sociolinguistic variation theory to the theory of Cognitive Grammar suggests teaching applications that follow from the theoretical discussion At the forefront of scholarship in the fields of interlanguage and variation theory scholarship, this book is directed to graduate students and researchers in applied English linguistics and second language acquisition, especially those with a background in sociolinguistics. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

This paper is situated within the new wave of L2 studies which explores the learner's acquisition of sociolinguistic variation. The study tracks the longitudinal development of liaison usage in relation to the potential differential impact of naturalistic vs classroom exposure conditions. Data for the study were collected at three intervals over a two-year period from Irish university learners, allowing for a dual analysis of their linguistic development during a year-long stay in France, and during their subsequent return to the foreign language classroom. Results point to the complexity of such development, whereby there is considerable individual variation, such that the heterogeneous exposure conditions in each environment seem to impact differentially the individual learners' development. © 2011, equinox publishing.

A situation of language contact between Spanish and Portuguese has existed along the border between Uruguay and Brazil since the first forays of Spanish and Portuguese colonizers into this territory in the early 1800s. As a result, most Uruguayans living along the border speak Portuguese. Dialects of this language spoken in Uruguay (which have been referred to as 'Dialectos Portugueses del Uruguay' or 'DPU') have been studied extensively (Carvalho 1998, 2003a, 2003b, 2004; Elizaincín 1976, 1979; Elizaincín, Behares and Barrios 1987; Hensey 1972; Rona 1965, to name a few). Surprisingly, very little linguistic research has focused on the Spanish of border communities, which demonstrates considerable influence from Portuguese, especially with regards to phonology. One of the most noticeable influences from this language is the use of occlusive articulations of intervocalic /d/ (which is typically realized as a fricative or phonetic zero in monolingual varieties of Spanish). This research analyzes the social stratification and conditioning of two of these language-specific variants (occlusive [d] and phonetic zero) for 63 bilinguals living in the border community of Rivera, Uruguay. © 2008, EQUINOX PUBLISHING.

One way to renew conversation between linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics is to bring concepts of linguistic ideology to the explanation of the iconization of specific sociolinguistic variables and associated sociolinguistic change. Sociolinguists such as Eckert (2000) and Milroy (2004) have made provocative efforts to incorporate linguistic-anthropological concepts into sociolinguistic explanation. What is still lacking is a full explanation of why specific linguistic variables emerge from the flow of speech and social life to become sociolinguistic icons or emblems and set off relatively rapid or intense changes. This article brings Joseph Errington's (1985) use of the concept of pragmatic salience to bear on insights gleaned from vanguard sociolinguistic and linguistic-anthropological work. Drawing on empirical examples from a spectrum of studies, a model is sketched from these elements to suggest an account of how an ideological bent directs linguistic change. © The author 2008 Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Located at the intersection of sociolinguistics and Hip Hop Studies, this cutting-edge book moves around the world - spanning Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas and the European Union - to explore Hip Hop cultures, youth identities, the politics of language, and the simultaneous processes of globalization and localization. Focusing closely on language, these scholars of sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, cultural studies, and critical pedagogies offer linguistic insights to the growing scholarship on Hip Hop Culture, while reorienting their respective fields by paying closer attention to processes of globalization and localization. The book engages complex processes such as transnationalism, (im)migration, cultural flow, and diaspora in an effort to expand current theoretical approaches to language choice and agency, speech style and stylization, codeswitching and language mixing, crossing and sociolinguistic variation, and language use and globalization. Moving throughout the Global Hip Hop Nation, through scenes as diverse as Hong Kong's urban center, Germany's Mannheim inner-city district of Weststadt, the Brazilian favelas, the streets of Lagos and Dar es Salaam, and the hoods of the San Francisco Bay Area, this global intellectual cipha breaks new ground in the ethnographic study of language and popular culture. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

The existing literature on vocalic variation in Scottish English has shown that variation tends to pattern according to the age, gender, and socioeconomic class of the speaker. However, studies that employ these gross social categories are unable to explain the variation that exists within these categories. This article therefore presents an alternative approach. Based on data from 16 adolescents who form a community of practice in west Fife, Scotland, this article attempts to consider both social and cognitive motivations for linguistic variation. The theoretical framework of Cognitive Grammar is particularly well-suited to incorporating sociolinguistic variation, and this article illustrates how an exploration of frequency effects and schematic organization can lead to a more insightful understanding of the patterning of two vocalic variables in a community. This article also explores the implications of these findings for our understanding of the place of sociolinguistics in cognitive theories of linguistics. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.

While practice theory has provided a valuable framework for establishing connections between individual-level sociolinguistic variation and social structures, Bourdieu's (1977) formulation of practice theory has been argued to inadequately address subjectivity. The sociologist C. Wright Mills' (1959) concept of the sociological imagination -consciousness of links among personal experiences, social structures, and historical processes -is posited as a partial solution, as it offers a framework for modeling one aspect of subjectivity. Use of the sociological imagination concept is demonstrated through a quantitative acoustic analysis of /o/fronting in Worthington, Ohio, a Columbus suburb confronting acute urban sprawl. The distribution of /o/fronting across 21 speakers largely resists traditional sociolinguistic explanations. A close analysis of four speakers' mental representations of the local tensions surrounding urban sprawl reveals significant differences which are argued to account for their variable use of fronted /o/. © Journal compilation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2008.

In this article, I investigate the implications of socially meaningful sociolinguistic variation for competence grammar, working from the point of view of HPSG as a kind of performance-plausible sign-based grammar. Taking data from African American Vernacular English variable copula absence as a case study, I argue that syntactic constraints and social meaning are intertwined. I present an overview of the literature on social meaning, discuss what grammars are models of, and argue that in order to model socially meaningful variation, competence grammars need to be extended to include social meaning, precompiled phrases, and probabilistic or frequentistic information. I then explore different heuristics for defining the boundaries of competence grammar and discuss the commonalities between the proposed additions and the kind of linguistic knowledge which is generally assumed to comprise competence grammar. © Cambridge University Press 2007.

This paper presents the results from the first study in the Sociolinguistic Variation in Australian Sign Language project (Schembri and Johnston 2004). This major project is a replication in the Australian deaf community of the quantitative investigations into variation in American Sign Language (ASL) that were conducted by Lucas, Bayley, and Valli (2001). In this specific study, we consider variation in the location parameter in a class of signs that includes the Australian Sign Language (Auslan) signs THINK, NAME and CLEVER In their citation form, these signs (like signs in the same class in ASL) are produced in contact with, in proximity to, or at the same height as the signer's forehead or above but often may The illustrations in this paper were produced by Shaun Fahey. This research was supported by Australian Research Council grant number LP346973 under the Linkage Scheme to the University of Newcastle and the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. As our chief consultants on the project, Ceil Lucas and Bob Bayley happily shared materials, passed on invaluable advice, and provided inspiration, support and encouragement. Barbara Horvath has also been particularly helpful; a copy of her Filemaker Pro database (created by her daughter Jane Horvath) saved us hours of work in database design, and her hands-on VARBRUL training was much appreciated. Julia Allen (Sydney), Patti Levitzke-Gray (Perth), Kevin Cresdee (Adelaide), Stephanie Linder (Melbourne), and Kim Pickering (Brisbane) acted as our deaf contact people and research assistants. Robert Adam, Breda Carty, Donovan Cresdee, and Brent Phillips provided useful input, and Darlene Thornton assisted with data coding.

Here, we present an analysis of 2,446 tokens of signs from this class that were collected from 205 deaf signers of Auslan in five sites across Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide). The results indicate that the variation in the use of the location parameter in these signs reflects both linguistic and social factors, as has also been reported for ASL. Despite similarities, however, we find that some of the particular factors at work, and the kinds of influence they have on variation in location, appear to differ in Auslan and ASL. Moreover, our results suggest that lexical frequency also plays a role, a factor not considered in the ASL study. The paper is organized into four parts. First, we provide a brief overview of sociolinguistic variation in Auslan and review the previous work on location variation in ASL by Lucas, Bayley, and Valli (2001). We then present the methodology used in our study, followed by a description of the results. Last, we discuss the implications of our findings for the understanding of sociolinguistic variation in signed and spoken languages. © by Gallaudet University. All rights reserved.

This commentary addresses the complexities of representation in sociolinguistic transcripts, considering the meaning potentials of different representational choices at the level of both ideology and identity. It considers the kinds of authenticity and evidence that are indexed by simplified versus more detailed transcripts, suggesting that a simplified transcript may give more direct access to elements of the original speaker's voice. Second, it discusses the role of transcripts as scholarly texts, and questions their use as sociolinguistic records suitable for reinterpretation by scholars who do not have access to the original recordings. Third, it emphasizes that the use of non-standard orthographies is an unreliable source of data on sociolinguistic variation, because few authors use non-standard forms in consistent and principled ways. Fourth, it proposes that translations may take different forms depending on whether they are efforts to be 'faithful' to 'authentic' speech in the target versus the source language. Finally, it reflects on the act of transcription as part of professional practice and identity among linguists.

Developments in the structure of societies, such as globalisation processes, compel us to devote more attention to issues of sociolinguistic variation in discourse, because features of such variation become ever more important to users. Yet a lot of discourse analysis starts from an old monolingual ideal, in which the sociolinguistic dimensions of the linguistic resources used by people remains underproblematised. This paper argues that our discourse analytic toolkit needs to be complemented with some seriously useful sociolinguistic tools and presents two such tools in this paper: orders of indexicality and polycentricity. Both concepts are designed to observe forms of linguistic and cultural variation that characterise Late Modern diasporic environments. © 2007 J. Blommaert.

We examine linguistic and sociolinguistic variables, such as tense, clause polarity, type of context, presence of subjunctive in the previous clause, speakers' age, socioeconomic level and gender. The form -se is not frequent in the Caracas spoken language and the variables which contribute significantly to the use of this form are the plusquamperfect tense, negative polarity, the presence of -ra in the antecedent clause, the "protasis" and "apodosis" contexts in the conditional sentence, the third and fourth socioeconomic strata and the speakers' age (30 to 45 years old).

This article presents the results from a preliminary investigation into the use of fingerspelling in Australian Sign Language (Auslan), drawing on data collected as part of the Sociolinguistic Variation in Australian Sign Language project (Schembri and Johnston 2004; Schembri, Johnston, and Goswell in press). This major project is a replication in the Australian deaf community of quantitative investigations into variation in American Sign Language (ASL) conducted by Lucas, Bayley, and Valli (2001). In this specific study, we consider variation in the use of the two-handed manual alphabet in Auslan, based on an analysis of 2,667 utterances collected from 205 deaf signers of Auslan in five sites across Australia (i.e., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide). The results indicate that the variation in the frequency of fingerspelling use most strongly correlates with signers' age, but may also vary according to region, as has also been reported for British Sign Language (BSL) (Sutton-Spence, Woll, and Allsop 1990).

Introduction Improved understanding of, and sensible approaches to, linguistic and cultural diversity in society are increasingly critical to promote equity and respect, particularly in schools and workplaces, for members of all groups in our society. Language is a core element, both in real differences and in the symbolic proxy it provides for other social parameters, such as ethnicity. Headlines in recent years on hot issues such as Ebonics and bilingual education demonstrate the widespread misunderstanding of the underpinnings of those educational issues and of language in general. While scholars understand many of the linguistic principles underlying variation in language and multilingualism in society, the many educational and social issues that arise in connection with diversity remain significant challenges. Better information and understanding of how language works and how people learn languages is sorely needed. Myths and misconceptions about language pervade public discourse and underlie policy decisions at all levels, and those knowledgeable about language need to be involved in those conversations. These issues were underscored by a panel convened by the National Science Foundation to consider the development of human capital, identifying research questions for the future and potential areas for contributions from linguistics (Wolfram and Schilling-Estes 1996b). The panel set its premise as follows: Given the cognitive basis of the human language faculty and the sociocultural context in which language use is embedded, linguistic investigation has played and should continue to play a central role in advancing our basic understanding of the effective utilization of human capital.

Why does human language vary from one person, or one group, to another? In what ways does it vary? How do linguists go about studying variation in, say, the sound system or the sentence structure of a particular language? Why is the study of language variation important outside the academic world, in say education, the law, employment or housing? This book provides an overview of these questions, bringing together a team of experts to survey key areas within the study of language variation and language change. Covering both the range of methods used to research variation in language, and the applications of such research to a variety of social contexts, it is essential reading for advanced students and researchers in sociolinguistics, communication, linguistic anthropology and applied linguistics. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.

Introduction During the past two or three decades, the field of language and law has increasingly become the focus of substantial linguistic interest. For some linguists (sometimes working in interdisciplinary concert with law professors), legal language is of interest in its own right. Also, however, linguists have more and more been engaged to use their professional expertise to assist lawyers in preparing and presenting their clients' cases, and by law-enforcement personnel interested in solving crimes and prosecuting criminals. Taken together, research that includes both the linguistic examination of legal language and the law's use of linguistic insights and expertise is generally termed Linguistics and Law. A term that is frequently applied more narrowly to the use of linguistics experts in the legal setting – especially in criminal proceedings – is Forensic Linguistics. Sociolinguistics is a sub-discipline that is especially important to scholars working in the general field of linguistics and law. Legal systems in all cultures general hinge crucially upon language, and, as Labov (1988:181–2) notes, the law is essentially a social institution, and sociolinguists thus appear to be especially well qualified to answer legal linguistic questions. As Labov notes, the centrality of empirical data to sociolinguistic research offers more to the law than other linguistic approaches; for example, a theory that builds models out of introspective judgments, extracting principles that are remote from observation and experiment, … is not the kind of theory that … [generates] evidence that allows … judges … to decide a case with confidence.… […] © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.

Introduction As can be seen from the other chapters in this volume, spoken languages have been the focus of most studies of sociolinguistic variation, but work has also been done on sociolinguistic variation in sign languages and a basic theoretical question arises: “In what way, if any, is modality reflected in variation?” That is, does sociolinguistic variation in sign languages exactly parallel what has been described for spoken languages or is the fact that sign languages are produced with the hands, face, and body as opposed to with the vocal apparatus borne out in the sociolinguistic variation that sign languages exhibit? Do visual sign languages and oral–aural spoken languages differ in fundamental ways when it comes to sociolinguistic variation? And what of the constraints, both linguistic and social, on this variation? This chapter will review the history of the study of sociolinguistic variation in sign languages, with a focus on American Sign Language (ASL), describe the ways in which sign language variation parallels spoken language variation, and discuss some ways in which modality differences may show up in variation. Signs have parts The title heading for this section is also the title of a 1980 chapter by Robbin Battison in which he reviews William C. Stokoe's ideas about the structure of sign languages. For the purposes of the present chapter, it is important for the reader to grasp a basic concept about the structure of the signs in any sign language, namely that signs are not at all indivisible wholes; rather, they have parts analogous to the parts of spoken words. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.

Variationist linguistic analysis As Milroy and Gordon (2003:5) document in their introduction to sociolinguistics, variationist methodology is often considered a subfield of sociolinguistics. Chambers maintains a similar view: “The social significance of language variation is only one aspect of the discipline of sociolinguistics, broadly conceived” (2002b:1). The current chapter focuses primarily on developments within sociolinguistic variation research but also notes that other traditionally nonsociolinguistic fields have also employed variationist methodology. For a superb comparison of variationist and formal linguistic scholarly roots, see Chambers' (2002b) Correlations which details why the axiom of categoricity is a postulate language scholars must either adopt or reject (2002b:15). Here, this chapter is intended to provide a hint as to why so many scholars, including many outside of sociolinguistics proper, have chosen to reject it. Preston describes the quantitative sociolinguistic paradigm as one where language variation is not random: “The frequency of their [variable elements] occurrences is predicted (a) by the shape and identity of the element itself and its linguistic context; (b) by the stylistic level of the interactions; and (c) by the social identities a [sic] relationships of the interlocutors” (2001:691). The emphasis is on how language variation works; variationist scholars reject models where variation is an aberrant state between two seemingly stable states, instead following the concept of inherent variability first propagated by Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog (1968). Although a wide variety of arguments are made in variationist work, they generally adhere to some basic tenets. Jones and Tagliamonte enumerate these “lines of evidence: (1) Which of the following factors is statistically significant? (2) What is the relative contributions of the linguistic features selected? Is it strong or weak? © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.

While recent studies have provided pivotal insights into the use of a range of sociolinguistic variables by speakers of Hexagonal French, this paper aims to illuminate how their usage may diverge/converge in the spoken language of the media. Based on a quantitative study of liaison realisation, /1/ deletion, and 'ne' deletion, the paper compares a number of trends behind their usage by journalists with those previously identified in that profession and among the general public. Results suggest that sociolinguistic variation is by no means a uniform phenomenon among journalists, but rather a number of (socio)linguistic factors impinge on such variation, just as in the case of the public. The results are discussed in terms of the differences and similarities that emerge across the variables, such that the specificity of the sociolinguistic variable in itself is seen to impact significantly on its use.

Readers of this journal have recently witnessed a discussion between Kanavillil Rajagopalan and Deirdre Wilson and Dan Sperber on the role of the social aspects in pragmatics. I would like to touch on this issue from another point of view, focusing on intercultural (contrastive, crosscultural, and interlanguage) pragmatics. Over the past twenty years this field has made substantial contributions to the extension of linguistic models and the understanding of the relation between language and culture, as well as expanding the basis for second language studies and language curriculum materials. The scope of this journal offers wonderful opportunities for interaction and collaboration between scholars researching and applying pragmatics in different ways interculturally. I would like to draw attention to some dimensions which, to my knowledge, have so far been on the margins of the field, focusing first on the speech act of introduction, the very beginning of interpersonal interaction, which I will show varies even within speakers of German. This example raises the issue of variation in intercultural pragmatics and to pericentric languages, ones with "several interacting centres, each of which provides at least some of (their) own (codified) norms" (Clyne 1992: 1). Different national varieties are linked to specific norms of expression and cultural values. Central to the discussion is the issue of what pragmatic norms should be expected of second language learners. In discussion of English, the most pericentric and international of all languages, the power of the pragmatics and discourse of the "native speaker" of particular varieties is critiqued within the context of certain cultural parameters. © Walter de Gruyter.

The grammar of a language is not only un système ou tout se tient; it also lies within a nexus involving time, space, and social relationships. On the dimension of time, descriptive and historical linguistics are not totally separate: native speakers' knowledge of their language may include recognition of archaic forms and foreign borrowings. As for space, native speakers' knowledge also includes awareness of geographical dialect variation. On the social dimension, the relevance of sociolinguistic variation is now widely recognized. Linguists who undertake to write grammars should consider all these factors, particularly as regards the interrelatedness between the grammar, the lexicon, and text collections.

Sindhi is an Indo-Aryan language with its roots in the lower Indus River valley. It takes its name from the Indus River, known in earlier times as the Sindhu. Today Sindhi is spoken in the province of Sindh, Pakistan, where it is recognized by the government as the official language of the province, home to an estimated 30-40 million people (projected from 1981 census data). Nearly half of the population of Sindh lives in rural areas, where Sindhi is the primary language. In the urban centers of Sindh, Sindhi competes for status and speakers with Urdu (the national language of Pakistan) and, increasingly, English. Sindhi is also spoken by about 2.5 million people in India, including major communities in Gujarat, Mumbai, and Pune, where immigrants from Sindh relocated after the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan. Beyond the Indian subcontinent, Sindhi is spoken by large diaspora communities in the United Kingdom and the United States, and around the world. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

China's participation in the global economy has brought about a new professional group -Chinese professionals working for foreign businesses (waiqi). Focusing on the linguistic practice of a group of waiqi professionals in Beijing, this study compares their speech with that of professionals working for stateowned enterprises. Both groups are natives of Beijing. Based on quantitative analysis of three Beijing Mandarin features and a tone feature revealing an influence from non-Mainland Mandarin varieties, the study shows that the waiqi group overwhelmingly used the non-local features much more frequently than the state professionals. It is argued that the waiqi professionals' speech cannot be described simply as speaking a more standard variety of Putonghua. They are constructing a cosmopolitan Mandarin style through selectively combining features from both regional and global sources. This non-local style of Mandarin does not strictly conform to the standard of Putonghua. Explanations for the differential practice of the two groups are sought through differences in the linguistic markets in which they participate. This study demonstrates that the traditional territorially-based approach to sociolinguistic variation on a local-standard dimension is inadequate in examining practices that employ linguistic resources from both local and supra-local sources. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This article is situated within the recent strand of SLA research which applies variationist sociolinguistic methods to the study of the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation by the L2 speaker. Whilst that research has tended to focus on the study of morphological and morphosyntactic variables, this article aims to investigate a number of acquisitional trends identified in previous research in relation to phonological variation, namely the variable deletion of /l/ by Irish advanced L2 speakers of French in both an instructed and study abroad environment. Based on quantitative results using GoldVarb 2001, the study further illuminates the difficulty that the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation poses to the instructed L2 speaker, who is found to make minimal use of informal sociolinguistic variants. In contrast, contact with native speakers in the native speech community is seen to allow the L2 speaker to make considerable sociolinguistic gains, not only in relation to the acquisition of the informal variant in itself, but also in relation to the underlying native speaker grammatical system as indicated by the constraint ordering at work behind use of the variable. © 2006, Cambridge University Press.

The paper explores the relations between syntactic variation and the large-scale social dimensions of gender and social class. It argues on the basis of an analysis of the marking of discourse-new entities in interview speech that syntactic variants may frequently be involved in sociolinguistic variation, but indirectly, as just one of a broad set of choices that includes forms drawn from other components of language besides syntax. The analysis shows that although there is no sociolinguistic variation in the use of the strategies speakers use to mark discourse-new information, there are significant social class and gender differences in the use of Noun Phrases that are not marked. Whilst acknowledging the risks of generalising on the basis of large-scale social categories, an interpretation of these differences is suggested in relation to findings from previous research that suggest differences in the interactive style of different gender and social class groups. The paper discusses some implications of the analysis for the fields of language variation and change, and pragmatics. © Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.

This paper illustrates a methodology for discovering whether speakers have knowledge of the non-categorical grammatical constraints which are evident in the distribution of sociolinguistic variables, through a case study of copula absence in AAVE. It is hypothesized that social and grammatical constraints on variation can interact. The matched-guise methodology of Lambert and others is adapted to determine whether the grammatical environment can affect listeners' social evaluation of a linguistic variable. The evidence, though preliminary, suggests that it can, and this in turn suggests that listeners do have knowledge of the relevant non-categorical constraints. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on a range of case studies, this systematic study demonstrates the variety of language usage in seventeenth-century France, a time considered to be the most "standardizing" in the history of French. Variation is analyzed in terms of gender, age and socio-economic status, or by the medium, register or genre used. The case studies present phonological, morphological, syntactic and lexical issues, posing a range of methodological questions for sociolinguists and historical linguists. © Cambridge University Press, 2009 and Wendy Ayres-Bennett 2004.

This paper explores the translation of sociolinguistic variation by examining the ways that African American English (AAE) is dubbed into German. In discussing this ubiquitous yet poorly studied area of language use, I show that ideas about language as an index to social groupings are transferable to the degree that the ideas overlap in the cultures in question. In the case of German, if the character being dubbed is young, male and tied to the street cultures of the urban inner city, then AAE is dubbed using a form of German that has links to the urban youth cultures of north-central Germany. The transferability of sociolinguistic variation is important to issues related to cross-cultural communication and the ideologies that may play a role in the outcomes of that communication as well as to linguistic creativity and language style more generally.

This study on the learning of sociolinguistic variants by 41 adolescents from a French immersion program in Toronto, Canada, synthesizes the findings of our research on this topic. This article provides answers to the following questions. First, do the immersion students use the same range of sociolinguistic variants as do speakers of Quebec French, who are used in our research as a first language (L1) benchmark? Second, do they use variants with the same discursive frequency as do L1 speakers? Third, is their use of variants correlated with the same linguistic constraints observable in L1 speech? Finally, what are the independent variables influencing their learning of Variants, for example: Treatment of variants by immersion teachers and authors of French language arts materials used in immersion programs; interactions with L1 speakers; influence of the students' L1(s); influence of intra-systemic factors - marked-ness of variants; and influence of the students' social characteristics - social standing, sex? © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.

The concept of indexical order is introduced, necessary to any empirical investigation of the inherently dialectical facts of indexicality. Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., 'T/V' deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed " oinoglossia ," 'wine talk'. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Language varies both in space and in time, as well as according to the linguistic environment in which a form is used. For example, the American Sign Language (ASL) sign DEAF1 has three possible forms. It can be produced with a movement from ear to chin (the citation or dictionary form), with a movement from chin to ear, or simply by contacting the cheek once (both noncitation forms). Even though the form of DEAF varies from signer to signer and even within the signing of the same signer, the variation we observe is far from random. Rather, signers' choices among the three forms of DEAF are systematically constrained by a range of factors at both the linguistic and the social levels. Thus, compared to signers in other parts of the USA, signers in Boston, Massachusetts, tend to be quite conservative in the choice of a form of DEAF. In contrast, signers in Kansas, Missouri, and Virginia tend to prefer noncitation forms. Indeed, a recent study conducted by three of the authors of this chapter showed that signers in these states used noncitation forms of DEAF 85 percent of the time, more than twice the rate of signers in Boston (Bayley et al. 2000; Lucas et al. 2001).The region of the country where a signer lives is not the only factor that affects the choice of a form of DEAF. For example, although ASL signers in Boston generally used more citation forms of DEAF than signers in other areas of the USA, Boston signers aged 55 and over were far less likely to choose a noncitation form of DEAF than were younger signers. Bayley et al. (2000) reported that Boston signers aged 55 and over used the citation form of DEAF 76 percent of the time. In contrast, signers aged between 26 and 54 used the citation form only 54 percent of the time, and signers aged between 15 and 25 used the citation form only 46 percent of the time. In addition, variation can be affected by linguistic factors. To continue with the example of DEAF, Lucas (1995) and Bayley et al. (2000) found that signers were very likely to use a noncitation form of DEAF when it was part of a compound, as in DEAF ! CULTURE or DEAF ! WORLD. However, when DEAF was a predicate adjective, as in PRO.1 DEAF ("I am deaf "), signers were likely to choose the citation form.As the example of variation in the form of DEAF shows, choices among variable linguistic forms are affected both by social (e.g., region, age) and by linguistic (e.g., grammatical class) factors or constraints. In this chapter, we review the study of language variation, with particular emphasis on the insights that such study can provide into language structure and social relations. We pay special attention to the many intersecting social factors that can influence variation and to the kinds of linguistic units and processes that vary in sign and spoken languages. We conclude with a detailed examination of three studies that represent some of the different types of research on variation in sign languages. Copyright © 2001 by Cambridge University Press.

We examine the importance of variation and other linguistic research for Deaf communities. Sociolinguistic variation in American Sign Language (ASL) was initially addressed by Carl Croneberg in the Dictionary of American Sign Language (DASL), the first dictionary of a sign language based on linguistic principles (Stokoe, Casterline, and Croneberg 1965). This work was followed by studies of lexical, phonological, and grammatical variation. The treatment of variation in the DASL will be reviewed and research on variation described, with emphasis on the findings from a largescale study of phonological variation. We will show that research on linguistic variation and other aspects of sign languages impacts Deaf communities in three ways.1 First, the recognition that ASL exhibits sociolinguistic variation like other systems that we recognize as languages reinforces the hard-won status of ASL and other sign languages as real languages. Second, the study of variation in sign languages reinforces the position that systematic variation, or "orderly heterogeneity," is integral to the structure of all languages (Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog 1968). Understanding the nature of a language requires an understanding of variation. This in turn relates to the increasing awareness of modality differences between spoken and sign languages. Third, the findings from research on sign language structure and variation have had a direct impact on the educational and employment opportunities available to Deaf people.

This article, part of a larger study of phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical variation in American Sign Language (ASL), examines lexical differences in the ASL varieties used by African American and white signers. Our goal is to reexamine claims made about the correlation of lexical variation with ethnicity as well as claims pertaining to the course of language change (see, e.g., Woodward 1976). Specifically, we examine three questions: (1) Are there lexical differences between African American and white signing? (2) What are the processes of change reflected in the varieties of ASL used by African American and white signers? (3) How does lexical innovation differ from phonological variation in the lexicon?To answer these questions, we focus on the responses of ASL signers to picture and fingerspelled stimuli designed to elicit specific lexical items.1 The elicitation task was part of a much larger study of sociolinguistic variation in ASL, described later in the paper. A brief review of research on lexical variation in ASL and African American signing demonstrates that the same kinds of issues that characterize lexical variation in spoken languages also characterize lexical variation in ASL, for example, phonological variation within the lexicon and occurrences of rapid lexical innovation related to changes in social norms.

This article investigates an external variable critical to the understanding of sociolinguistic variation in a rural, tri-ethnic community in the Southern United States. Cultural identity, the orientation of the speaker to the community, was first observed in variationist work by Labov (1963) but has not been regularly analyzed as have sex, age, and ethnicity. Cultural identity is postulated as a speaker's orientation to the local and larger regional cultures, and in Warren County, North Carolina, this orientation correlates strongly with vernacular variants of present and past tense be. For copula absence (e.g. They 0 real nice people), was regularization (e.g. We was going), and past tense wont (e.g. We wont gonna go), the cultural identity of the speaker had statistically significant effects on language variation. To understand language variation in this community, the interactions of cultural identity and other external variables must be considered.

It is argued that a grammaticization perspective affords insights on the problem of functional equivalence in variables "above and beyond phonology." This is a study of variation between aspectual expressions involving Spanish estar 'be located' and andar 'go around' + gerund. An analysis of Mexican oral corpora shows both linguistic and social conditioning: Each auxiliary is favored by certain classes of main verbs, and andar is favored in popular varieties. Semantic bleaching along parallel paths results in layering in the domain of progressive aspect, while retention results in synchronic distribution patterns congruent with the original meaning of the source constructions. Thus, once meaningful aspectual differences become distributional routines. At the same time, the patterning of verbs denoting outdoor activities with andar leads to social differences and the association of this variant with rural and popular varieties.

Variation in language on the basis of formality (register variation) is often neglected both in grammatical descriptions and in sociolinguistic analyses. I demonstrate here that in Sinhala, and perhaps in other diglossic languages, register variation in syntax cannot be ignored. In a Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) analysis based on a corpus of naturally occurring Sinhala texts, I propose an analysis of register variation in which the syntax of all observed registers is accounted for within a single grammar. I further explain how the approach to register variation developed here can be extended to other types of sociolinguistic variation. © 2000 Cambridge University Press.

This article examines the differing degrees to which young male and female speakers are apparently participating in a process of linguistic change currently taking place in southern French. Previous research suggests that younger females in southern France are adopting the treatment of schwa characteristic of the northern standard variety; but no study of linguistic change in southern French has yet been carried out through a direct, variationist comparison of young male and female speakers. We analyze here the linguistic contexts in which schwa is most susceptible to penetration by the northern French norm. Much research on the differential treatment by male and female speakers of variable linguistic forms has shown that young males tend to resist the introduction of supraregional linguistic forms, while females adopt them. As well as discussing new evidence on a French-specific research issue, we also examine the cross-linguistic significance of the French findings. Further, we attempt to shed new light on the behavior of male and female speakers in relation to national and regional linguistic forms, and to reconsider some issues associated with the definition of standard languages.

This paper examines variation in Zulu in the Greater Durban Area (GDA). Certain social networks are identified and the language varieties generated by these networks are examined. The social context and function of the language varieties spoken in eduational institutions, isiGura, in shebeens, isi Thaveni, and by soccer enthusiasts, isiNgura are analysed. Some recommendations are made regarding the relationship of these non-standard varieties to Standard Zulu. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

On the evidence of textual attestations from 1676-1835, early Barba-dian English is shown to have exhibited many more nonstandard features than is generally recognized. Such features, which are commonly, if not exclu-sively, found in pidgins and creoles, include vowel epenthesis, paragoge and initial s-deletion processes, creole tense-modality-aspect marking, copula absence, the use of invariant no as a preverbal negative and as an emphatic positive marker, the occurrence of one as indefinite article, and a variety of morphologically unmarked pronominal forms. The texts consist of samples of African and Afro-Barbadian speech from historical sources, including ones which linguists have not previously considered. The textual samples are examined century by century, accom-panied by a detailed account of the contemporary sociohistorical setting, and interpreted in terms of known and inferred Caribbean patterns of sociolinguistic variation, both in the present and in the past. It is concluded that while early Barbadian speech comprised a range of varieties, creole-like varieties were undoubtedly a part of that range. © 1994 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This paper begins by noting that the dominance of social class as a speaker variable and interpretative category has led to unsatisfactory interpretations of linguistic variability, and it goes on to investigate the use of the variables social class, social network, and gender. Evidence and arguments are produced to suggest that gender difference is often prior to social class in accounting for sociolinguistic variation. Next, the complex relationship between social class and social network is examined. Finally, the article presents data from the authors’own research to demonstrate how all three variables may be implicated in a complex way in an account of language variation and change. The authors conclude that sociolinguistics needs to develop more sophistication in dealing with these variables. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Admitting, or denying, that one has done something is a prototypical example of a so-called speech act (Searle 1969, 1975). Searle conceives of speech acts as doings by individual speakers. For example, admitting guilt would be something enacted by one single-person, the perpetrator, who thereby assumes responsibility for a particular, possibly unlawful, action performed in the past. In this paper, we will look at data from two judicial contexts, criminal court trials and police interrogations, in which admissions (and denials) obviously constitute significant, and institutionalized, elements. In opposition to speech-act theory, we will demonstrate that admissions or denials of guilt are communicative acts, performed in collaboration between two parties, i.e. the professional interviewer (judge or police officer) and the person, defendant or suspect, who allegedly had to admit or deny responsibility for a criminal action. In a comprehensive corpus (70 court trials and 30 police interrogations) we will study the sociolinguistic variation in the communicative acts involved. © 1993.

The first French grammarians to consider the French language condemned variation — historical variation, geographical variation, and sociolinguistic variation. For the French language to be first among vernacular languages, it had to have fixity, to be governed by absolute rules. How can one determine if a lexical item, pronunciation feature, or morphological feature should be accepted? Some would study the best authors, but the list of such authors is a matter of debate. Others would define the ‘true French’ geographically, but they tend to choose their own regions. Ultimately, the choice depends on a sense of ‘usage’ which is in harmony with the ‘naïve puissance’ of the language, the pursuit of which may ultimately lead to a reunification of word and object, a unity lost at the Tower of Babel. The grammarians’ attacks on variation serve biblical as well as political destiny. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

This paper is a report on a sociolinguistic survey conducted in Tokyo, Japan. The purpose of this study is to explore the social factors which relate to the use of non-standard expressions among younger people. The data were processed mainly with multiple regression analysis and the following results were obtained: (1) males tend to use more non-standard forms than females; (2) T.V. exposure affects speakers to use non-standard forms, implying that the present-day mass media do not have so much influence over the standardization, at least among younger people; and (3) the influence of friendship networks operates only on non-standard forms and not on standards, suggesting their different distributional patterns within groups; that is, standards are distributed in a random manner, while non-standards are focalized into smaller sectors (sociolinguistic variation, friendship networks, younger speakers, statistical analysis, Japanese). © 1990.

This is a report of a study of social marking in second language pronunciation. In particular, it tested out Trudgill's (1981) suggestion that sounds that are most likely to undergo sociolinguistic variation, that is, that may become social markers, are those that Labov (1972a, 1972b), calls stereotypes. This study sought to determine whether there were certain aspects of English pronunciation that native Spanish speakers would, at some level of awareness, associate with American English/American identity. The speakers were asked to perform several tasks, including a mimic of an American speaking Spanish with an American accent (following Flege & Hammond, 1982). Among the results, speakers displayed a tacit awareness of English–Spanish sound distinctions (in particular, allophonic differences) in performing the mimic (supporting Flege & Hammond, 1982). Additionally, some of the alterations they were very conscious of held as stereotypes of American English. Support was found for Trudgill's (1981) suggestion. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

Most researchers of Arabic sociolinguistics assume the existence of a soc ciolinguistic continuum with a local vernacular at the bottom and the standard variety at the top. Those researchers seem to equate the terms “pres-tige” and “standard”; consequently, they tend to consider Modem Standard Arabic (MSA) as the only prestige variety in all settings. This article presents evidence showing that if an adequate description of sociolinguistic variation of spoken Arabic is to be met, it is necessary to posit not only one standard speech variety, MSA, but also other prestigious local or regional varieties which act as local spoken standards competing with MSA in informal settings. It will be shown in the reported cases that in certain contexts speakers tend to switch from their local forms though these latter may be identical to MSA to other local features characteristic of other dominant social groups and that happen to be marked [-MSA]. These local prestigious norms act like the standard spoken norms in informal settings.

Many speakers the current Australian English often use a high-rising intonation in statements. This usage, which has been termed Australian Questioning Intonation (AQI), has a nonpropositional, interactive meaning (checking for listener comprehension) and interacts with the turn-taking mechanism the conversation. A quantitative study the the use the AQI in Sydney reveals that it has the social distribution characteristic the a language change in progress: higher rates the usage among working-class speakers, teenagers, and women. Real time data confirm this, showing that the form was almost nonexistent in this speech community two decades earlier. The social motivations the this innovation are examined in terms the local identity and the entry the new ethnic groups into the community, and possible linguistic sources are discussed. The utility the quantitative methods in studying meaningful linguistic variables is demonstrated.

The style dimension of language variation has not been adequately explained in sociolinguistic theory. Stylistic or intraspeaker variation derives from and.mirrors interspeaker variation. Style is essentially speakers’ response to their audience. In audience design, speakers accommodate primarily to their addressee. Third persons auditors and overhearers affect style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass communication.

Standardization of terminology is a process calling for a thoughtful combination of adherence to linguistic principles and awareness of the sociocultural issues involved. The case of Serbo-Croatian linguistic terminology currently used in Yugoslavia may serve as an example of the different dimensions of sociolinguistic variation in this area. Especially in culturally heterogeneous societies, the distinction between standardization and unification must be observed.

This paper surveys and illustrates ten years of research done on sociophonological variation in Viennese German from a methodological point of view. It shows how variants of the same word form are collected and analyzed and how two types of rules are differentiated: (1) phonostylistic (optional) phonological rules of the fast/casual and formal hyperarticulate speech, both of Standard Austrian German and Viennese German Dialect; and (2) bidirectional input switch rules between these two strata. Psycholinguistic lab experiments are summarized, which vouch for the psychological reality of sociolinguistic concepts used. A theory of sociopsychological speech situations is described as well as the application of quantitative and qualitative sociolinguistic methods used. A major illustration of our approach is taken from the sociolinguistic study of defendants at court. The conclusion summarizes major claims.

This paper presents empirical data (collected from nine Thai ESL learners) to support the claim that there is sociolinguistic variation and style shifting in interlanguage phonology, just as there is in the phonology of any natural language. The study addresses several theoretical questions: 1. Is interlanguage more permeable to a superordinate rule system in formal than in informal situations? 2. If it is more permeable, does the native language or the target language act as the superordinate rule system? 3. Does phonological transfer follow the sociolinguistic rules of the native language? 4. Does Monitoring operate on a continuum, increasing in formal contexts, and thereby producing a style shift? The findings are consistent with the point of view that interlanguage becomes permeable to a superordinate rule system in formal situations. In these data, the target language (English) acted as the superordinate rule system when the variable examined had no social meaning in the native language (Thai), but when the variable was in fact strongly marked for social value in Thai, the native language (Thai) was adopted as the superordinate rule system. The latter style shifting involved transfer of a socially appropriate variant. Finally, it was found that monitoring (attention to speech) and conscious Monitoring with a learned phonological rule operated on a sliding scale, increasing in formal contexts, and resulting in a style shift. © 1980 Language Learning Research Club, University of Michigan

Recent research in American Sign Language (ASL) has concentrated on demonstrating that ASL, a language channelled through the manual-visual modality, has linguistic properties similar to those of oral languages, except for physical sound. The absence of sound, however, really presents no theoretical problem since ASL has a formational level of structure analogous to, but not dependent on, the phonological component of oral languages (Stokoe 1960; Battison 1974).This paper will discuss a relatively new area of research in Sign linguistics, ethnic-social variation. Because of attitudes and educational policy, Black signers in the South have developed different varieties of signing from Whites. Concentrating primarily on Black signs in Georgia, this paper will discuss some of the lexical and formational (phonological) variation observed in old and young Black signers.

Linguistic geography has remained relatively unaffected by recent developments in sociolinguistic theory and method and theoretical geography. In this paper it is argued that insights and techniques from both these disciplines will be of value in improving descriptions of geographical variation in language, and that these improvements will in turn lead to more adequate explanations for certain of the social and spatial characteristics of linguistic change. Evidence in favour of a sociolinguistic methodology and new cartographic techniques in dialect geography is drawn from empirical studies in urban dialectology, in East Anglia, England, and rural dialectology, in Norway.

Women use linguistic forms associated with the prestige standard more frequently than men. One reason for this is that working-class speech has favourable connotations for male speakers. Favourable attitudes to nonstandard speech are not normally expressed, however, and emerge only in inaccurate self-evaluation test responses. Patterns of sex differentiation deviating from the norm indicate that a linguistic change is taking place: standard forms are introduced by middle-class women, non-standard forms by working-class men.
