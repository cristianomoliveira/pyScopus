Digital technologies have nowadays a significant impact on how new business ventures are imagined and created. The arising technology paradigm is leveraging the potential of collaboration and collective intelligence to design and launch more robust and sustainable entrepreneurial initiatives. However, although the topic of digital entrepreneurship is relevant and timely, there is a limited literature discussion on the real impact of digital technologies and collaboration on the entrepreneurial process. Further research is needed to describe the nature and characteristics of the entrepreneurial ecosystem enabled by the new socio-technical paradigm. Based on extant literature, this article proposes a definition of digital entrepreneurship ecosystem by highlighting the integrated digital-output and digital-environment perspectives. A collective intelligence approach is then adopted to define a descriptive framework and identify the distinguishing genes of a digital entrepreneurship ecosystem. Four dimensions associated to digital actors (who), digital activities (what), digital motivations (why), and digital organization (how) are defined and discussed. The framework was also applied to describe 9 real cases of companies and initiatives, which are analyzed as digital entrepreneurship ecosystems along the four key dimensions presented. The article ends with a discussion about the results and a research agenda for future studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Society demands the colleges, besides the education, to contribute to the innovation system for the social-economic development. Through the lens of the Entrepreneurial Architecture —which includes constructs, structure, systems, leadership, strategies and culture— a qualitative research is presented herein. It was conducted based on a single case at a private college with its technology endowment. The results indicate that this college is being adapted to a new reality and is carrying out actions intended to integrate the college ecosystem of science and technology in order to foster both innovation and entrepreneurship. © 2020 Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Purpose: Unlike previous studies that examine the role of different entrepreneurial ecosystem factors in predicting entrepreneurial intentions. The purpose of this study is to explain the direct effects of entrepreneurial ecosystem factors effecting entrepreneurial intentions and configurational combinations of entrepreneurial ecosystem factors that cause high or low entrepreneurial intentions among female university students in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: The study used structured survey-questionnaire based data collected from 310 female students enrolled in different universities in Saudi Arabia. The study used symmetric analysis using structural equation modeling technique, whereas asymmetric analysis is performed using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, necessary condition analysis is also used to identify the role of different entrepreneurial ecosystem factors in increasing and/or decreasing entrepreneurial intentions among young Saudi women. Findings: The results of symmetrical analysis show that access to finance, access to physical infrastructure, and cultural factors are not significantly associated with entrepreneurial intentions, whereas government policies and regulations, government programs and support, social factors and entrepreneurship education and training are significantly associated with the development of entrepreneurial intentions among female Saudi university students. While the result of asymmetrical analysis provides 15 configurational models that explains the high levels of certain factors to predict entrepreneurial intentions among female university students in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, social support is found as necessary condition in majority of models to predict high levels of entrepreneurial intentions among female Saudi university students. Practical implications: The results of the study provide empirical evidence to policymakers in Saudi Arabia. The study proposes that it is not mandatory that the high levels of all entrepreneurial ecosystem factors are important to predict high entrepreneurial intentions, rather in some conditions the low levels of certain factors are obligatory to predict high levels of entrepreneurial intentions. Originality/value: Two-step mix-method approach is used in this study containing analysis of symmetric within entrepreneurial ecosystem increase or decrease entrepreneurial intentions among female university students in Saudi Arabia. There has been plenty of research that examines the role of entrepreneurial ecosystem factors in development of university students’ entrepreneurial intentions, however there is less research evident in the entrepreneurship literature that examine the configurational effects of factors within entrepreneurial ecosystem in increasing and/or decreasing entrepreneurial intentions among female university students. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach tries to understand the mechanisms underlying new business creation and helps develop tools, governmental policies and support systems that enhance the outcomes of entrepreneurship activities. To ensure a better understanding of those mechanisms, this study aims to contrast regional policies in emerging economies that are designed to foster local new business creation and development. Design/methodology/approach: One of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s surveys, the National Experts’ Survey, was applied to a sample of N = 675 key informants in Mexico at ten entities, seven of whom were categorized as non-centrally located. The authors used non-parametric statistics to compare the differences between centrally and non-centrally located experts. Findings: The main results indicate that non-centrally located experts perceive their regions to be in a worse position than centrally located experts in terms of government policies regulation, post-school education and commercial and physical infrastructure, but surprisingly in a better position regarding financial access, general government policy, government programs, primary and secondary education, R&D transfer, market dynamism and openness and cultural and social norms. Practical implications: These findings have policy implications for all levels of government in Mexico, which must prioritize the homologation of opportunities for people in both large and small cities. Originality/value: The replication of a Chilean study contributes to the empirical literature of regional entrepreneurial ecosystems in emerging economies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems, systems of inter-related forces that promote and sustain regional entrepreneurship, are increasingly viewed as sources of innovation, economic development and community revitalization. Regions with emerging, underdeveloped or depressed economies are attempting to develop their nascent entrepreneurial ecosystems in the hopes of experiencing the positive benefits of entrepreneurial activity. For nascent entrepreneurial ecosystems to grow requires resources. However, how nascent entrepreneurial ecosystems manage their resource dependencies and the tensions that exist between creating and attracting resources are not clear. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theory of nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem resource dependence. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper analyzes entrepreneurial ecosystems as meta-organizations and builds on resource dependence theory to explain how nascent ecosystems respond to environmental dependencies and their resource needs through internal and external strategies. Findings: Two specific strategies used by nascent entrepreneurial ecosystems to manage resource dependence – bridging and buffer – are explored. It is proposed that there is a positive relationship between the resource dependence of a nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem and its use of bridging and buffering activities. Two ecosystem characteristics that influence the pursuit of bridging and buffering – ecosystem size and the presence of collaborative values – are also identified. In addition, it is theorized that resource dependence strategies influence a key, system-level characteristic of entrepreneurial ecosystems: resilience, the ecosystem’s ability to respond and adapt to internal and external disruptions. Originality/value: The theory presented generates insights into how nascent entrepreneurial ecosystems create and obtain resources when ecosystems are unmunificent, resource-constrained or underdeveloped. The theorizing addresses which resource dependence strategy – buffering or bridging – has a stronger link to resource dependence (and resilience) and under what conditions these linkages occur. The theoretical model generates insights for research on entrepreneurship in emerging and developed economies and produces practical implications for ecosystem participants, policymakers and economic development organizations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

As policy-makers and advocates seek to harness the ‘Maker movement’ for regional innovation and economic development, attention is turning to the role of regional ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’ in supporting Makers’ growth potential. Through interviews with 92 Maker enterprises across three industry subsectors in two regions, the paper demonstrates how the materiality of manufacturing processes, products and end markets influences Makers’ growth trajectories, and their effects on the role of regional agglomeration economies. This adds an important material dimension to ongoing academic discussions of industry relatedness focused principally on knowledge transfer, and further suggests that targeted industrial retention may complement manufacturing entrepreneurship policies. © 2019, © 2019 Regional Studies Association.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems are vital sources of innovation and critical engines for economic growth. In this study, we use text-based analysis, network visualizations, and topic modeling of nearly 60 000 venture business descriptions-i.e., how ventures present technologies and products to key stakeholders including customers, employees, and investors-to examine the structure of 35 global entrepreneurial ecosystems. Rather than using predefined industry classifications, we allow the structural configurations to emerge endogenously revealing a more variegated perspective of venture strategic positioning in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our study makes several important contributions. First, by examining strategic positioning statements of geographically defined ventures, we contribute and advance our understanding of the geography of innovation and structure of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our results indicate that there are wide differences in entrepreneurial ecosystem size, structure, composition, and venture strategic positioning. Second, methodologically, we use novel computational approaches and introduce visualization as a powerful means to understand entrepreneurial ecosystems. Third, our results show that ventures from widely different industries often use similar position statements, thus highlighting that ecosystems are indeed not just defined by industries, but also strategic positioning. We conclude with theoretical and managerial implications. © 2018 IEEE.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) are receiving intense attention. However, the revitalization of inactive EEs in unmunificent contexts is understudied. To investigate this phenomenon, an inductive study was conducted of a once-vibrant EE that became dormant because of an undiversified industrial base and a precipitous decline in its regional economy. The study revealed that the community members working to revitalize the city's EE (“EE champions”) used a holistic collection of economic, socio-cultural, community, and discursive strategies. The findings have implications for scholars focused on entrepreneurship in extreme and atypical contexts, the micro-foundations of EEs, and EE leadership. The study also generates concrete insights for practitioners seeking to reinvigorate EEs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Technological innovation is the new backbone for companies. Exploiting and exploring new knowledge increase the chance of survival in the current dynamic market. Alongside, there are countries were be an innovative need to face up social and political challenges. This has transformed their economy, spreading an entrepreneurial mindset mingled with the willing to help a local community. This phenomenon is called social entrepreneurship which is leveraging new economies and building wealth, environmental system. In this vein, the present research seeks to offer qualitative research on 142 social entrepreneurs in an emerging country. The scope is to analyse if social entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial characteristics, and entrepreneurial ecosystem influence innovation. As emerged, technological innovation is affected by the first two factors but the entrepreneurial ecosystem is still not supportive. New, several activities should be organised by the government to assist entrepreneurs, whereas, the entrepreneurs are socially motivated to build up his enterprise. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Innovation ecosystems, including technology parks and incubators, endeavor to achieve a high density of startups that is rich in social capital to help tenants evolve. Given the importance of social capital on startup success and the opportunity for social capital diffusion in high-density ecosystems, the inconclusive impact of ecosystems on firm performance warrants further attention. We present a startup survival model that distinguishes between access to social capital and using it. Empirical tests with the longitudinal Kauffman Firm Survey find that those startups that use social capital by collaborating with other agents (universities, industries, and government organizations) significantly outperform startups that do not. However, we also observe that the amount of social capital available in an ecosystem counterintuitively does not correlate with a tenant's use of it, and correlates weakly with longer life expectancy. These results are moderated by whether the tenant is a high-tech startup or not. Findings contribute to extant research in innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Policy and pedagogical recommendations for leveraging an ecosystem to improve firm performance and achieve the ultimate goal of regional economic development are discussed. © 2019 IEEE.

In the context of economic crisis, it is necessary to drive changes in the productive model towards a smart society. Particularly in urban areas, the Smart City movement has become an agent for change to help fight the loss of competitiveness and unemployment. Literature review shows that there is little regarding the generation of knowledge and entrepreneurial activity in the context of a smart city and in Spain in particular. This study contributes to filling this gap. We start by identifying the potential sources of entrepreneurial opportunities that a medium-sized smart city may offer based on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship. We then provide empirical evidence that the Smart City label has positively influenced the effective creation of new businesses. To this end, we examine 44 Spanish Smart City initiatives included and classified in the Smart City Index according to their smartness level. Our results confirm the relation between the Smart City label and the entrepreneurship rate. Moreover, they allow us to present some relevant considerations and implications concerning the maturing process of Smart City initiatives. These considerations are of particular interest for those agents involved in the smart city entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Agglomeration-oriented theories have grown significantly in the past decade in the explanation and promotion of entrepreneurship. Theoretical frameworks and normative models such as entrepreneurial ecosystems are insufficient to observe, explain, and inform policies at the communal level in rural contexts. In this paper, we propose a socio-spatial lens as a more fruitful way of understanding the holistic picture of rural entrepreneurship. By means of abductive research, we explore the distinct elements of entrepreneurial places in rural contexts and derive an integrated meso-level framework, comprising place-sensitive determinations and dimensions, to observe and further analyse the enabling conditions of such places. The findings obtained and the framework developed will be of great use for the evaluation and decision-making, regarding entrepreneurship in rural communities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Sussan and Acs (Small Business Economics, 49(1), 55–73, 2017) proposed the “Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystem” (DEE), a novel framework to guide our understanding of entrepreneurship in the digital age. By integrating literatures on digital ecosystem and entrepreneurial ecosystem, they brought to attention the importance of examining entrepreneurship as an outcome of interactions between biotic and abiotic entities represented by four concepts: Digital User Citizenship, Digital Entrepreneurship, Digital Infrastructure Governance, and Digital Marketplace. This paper revisits, critiques, and refines the framework through the following reconfigurations: (1) Digital User Citizenship is reintroduced as a heterogeneous group of users differentiated by their primary activity, as either consumers or producers. (2) Digital Technology Entrepreneurship encompasses all agents that build complementary products and services connecting to platforms. (3) Digital Multi-sided Platform is the intermediary for transaction of goods and services, and also a medium of knowledge exchanges that enables and facilitates experimentation, entrepreneurial innovation, and value creation. The main contribution of the paper is in the reconfigurations that clearly lay the ground for a more sustainable DEE—one in which user privacy is protected, platform efficiency enhanced, market competition encouraged, and digital infrastructure secured. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Entrepreneurship is recognized as an engine for the economy. However, Latin America must promote higher opportunities for the creation of new businesses, especially for technology-based ventures. In this sense, the Center for Global Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CGIE) of the University of Texas at Austin offers a Master of Science in Technology Commercialization (MCCT) that prepares students with methodologies to promote the creation of new businesses in Mexico. This study aims to know the contribution of training to the creation of new companies, and its role in the innovation and the technology transfer processes, from the viewpoint of the participants. This research presents a case study that analyzes the impact of the MCCT through the analysis of the data of a survey answered by 109 former students of this center. Findings show that the methodologies developed by the MCCT allow the creation of technology-based enterprises and entrepreneurial skills in students. This study presents good practices that can be emulated by other countries in the region, as well as recognizing the great value the role of higher education in creating synergies between actors of the innovation ecosystem that strengthen social and economic growth. © 2019 by the authors.

Context: Software startups develop innovative products through which they scale their business rapidly, and thus, provide value to the economy, including job generation. However, most startups fail within two years of their launch because of a poor problem-solution fit and negligence of the learning process during minimum viable product (MVP) development. An ideal startup ecosystem can assist in MVP development by providing the necessary entrepreneurial education and technical skills to founding team members for identifying problem-solution fit for their product idea, allowing them to find the right product-market fit. However, existing knowledge on the effect of the startup ecosystem elements on the MVP development is limited. Objective: The empirical study presented in this article aims to identify the effect of the six ecosystem elements (entrepreneurs, technology, market, support factors, finance, and human capital) on MVP development. Method: We conducted a study with 13 software startups and five supporting organizations (accelerators, incubator, co-working space, and investment firm) in the startup ecosystem of the city of Oulu in Finland. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observation, and materials. Results: The study results showed that internal sources are most common for identifying requirements for the product idea for MVP development. The findings indicate that supporting factors, such as incubators and accelerators, can influence MVP development by providing young founders with the necessary entrepreneurship skills and education needed to create the right product-market fit. Conclusions: We conclude from this study of a regional startup ecosystem that the MVP development process is most affected by founding team members’ experiences and skill sets and by advanced technologies. Furthermore, a constructive startup ecosystem around software startups can boost up the creation of an effective MVP to test product ideas and find a product-market fit. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this article and the special issue is to improve our understanding of the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications of the effectiveness of technology transfer policies on entrepreneurial innovation. We accomplish this objective by examining the relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation and public policies in the 186 papers published from 1970 to 2019. Our analysis begins by clarifying the definition of entrepreneurial innovations and outlining the published research per context. We then present the seven papers that contribute to this special issue. We conclude by outlining an agenda for additional research on this topic. © 2019, The Author(s).

This article utilizes a unique database (PLACE, the PLatform for Advancing Community Economies) to explore relationships between founders’ prior work experiences and the outcomes of their entrepreneurial firms. The authors capture and compare multiple, intersecting, often overlapping, prior work experiences and assess their differential interactions within a local ecosystem. They augment existing empirical research, which has looked most closely at the impact of prior employment on firm financing and survival, to include labor market effects. Results show important differences in firm-level employment outcomes across prior work experiences, with an advantage accruing to founders with prior work experience in local life science firms. © The Author(s) 2019.

With the growing attention to entrepreneurship as an engine of job creation and economic development, it is important for social scientists who are broadly interested in labor market and employment topics to focus attention on new firms and the policies and practices that surround them. The authors argue that the next generation of scholarship should pay particular attention to labor market institutions, the ecosystem of existing employers, and the human resource management practices that provide the strategic context for entrepreneurs and shape the career opportunities for workers. Remarkable variation occurs across space and time in the prevalence and performance of entrepreneurs. There are also many open questions as to the antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurship, for entrepreneurs, their communities, and their employees. The availability of new administrative data across many countries will allow for comparative cross-national studies and will provide opportunities to bring qualitative and mixed-method approaches to entrepreneurial labor market studies. This introduction and the articles in this special issue offer a path forward. © The Author(s) 2019.

Sustainable entrepreneurs are key actors in sustainability transitions; they develop needed innovations, create markets, and pressure incumbents. While socio-technical transitions literature is well developed, questions remain in terms of (1) the different roles that sustainable entrepreneurs can play in sustainable transitions, and (2) how best to empower these roles. To explore these challenges, we review literature and construct a framework combining the multilevel perspective and entrepreneurial ecosystem perspective. We apply this framework to the context of climate-smart agriculture in (Western and Central) Europe. By analysing semi-structured interview data (n = 27) we find that sustainable entrepreneurs are constrained by ineffective policy, resistant users, as well as novel alignment issues within the supply chain. We focus on the role of sustainable entrepreneurs as coordinators of action rather than developers of technological innovation within transition contexts characterised by low landscape pressures, large unmotivated incumbent firms, low consumer awareness and demand, and unincentivized users (farmers). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Millions of people are dependent on tropical forests for livelihood. However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships. Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments. To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation. © 2019

Purpose: Migrant enterprises comprise about 10 per cent of all enterprises in Germany and are therefore a crucial part of the German economy and its entrepreneurial ecosystems. Relatedly, migrant entrepreneurship is a highly recognized topic within political discussions as well as within entrepreneurship research. While there is already an impressive body of work regarding the nature and quality of migrant enterprises, many questions regarding the personal motives and satisfaction of migrant entrepreneurs still remain unanswered, particularly with regards to their job satisfaction. Thus, this study aims to address such questions regarding the job satisfaction of entrepreneurs with different backgrounds. Design/methodology/approach: Using the German Socio-Economic Panel data set, the authors close this research gap by investigating the job satisfaction of migrant entrepreneurs in Germany compared with native entrepreneurs. Findings: First generation migrants show, in general, less job satisfaction than the native population. Second generation male migrant entrepreneurs’ show less job satisfaction; however, this association is reversed for females: second generation female migrant entrepreneurs are more satisfied with their self-employment than their native counterparts. Originality/value: These differing results lead to differing implications for policymakers who wish to create and develop entrepreneurial and labour market support for different target groups. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study analyzes how the entrepreneurial ecosystem and different types of entrepreneurship impact regional performance. By analyzing 121 European Union regions between 2012 and 2014, it is found that quantity (Kirznerian) entrepreneurship negatively impacts regional performance, while this effect turns positive in the case of quality (Schumpeterian) entrepreneurship. Also, regions with a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem have a greater capacity to materialize the effects of high business-formation rates, regardless of their quality (Kirznerian entrepreneurship), while regions with weak entrepreneurial ecosystem may rely on innovative (Schumpeterian) entrepreneurs to compensate for the absence of entrepreneurship support policies and increase their economic outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Purpose: Entrepreneurship education has moved from an elitist view focussing on a start-up and picking-the-winners philosophy towards a broader enterprising behaviour approach; recognising entrepreneurship as an activity of relevance for everybody. The purpose of this paper is to extend this development and identify how university entrepreneurial ecosystems can be expanded to support communities that are under-represented in entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an integrative literature review (Torraco, 2005), this paper draws together and synthesises literature from the field of entrepreneurship, higher education studies and under-represented communities in an integrated fashion, leading to the development of a new conceptual model. Findings: This paper challenges the traditional role of universities in supporting entrepreneurship as focussing mainly on economic growth and new venture creation, and identifies how universities are also positioned to provide greater civic support to entrepreneurial learning amongst under-represented communities. Through a critical analysis of the literature, the conceptual model proposed identifies six key considerations in the expansion of university entrepreneurial ecosystems for under-represented communities. Practical implications: There are currently 96.6m people at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU (OECD, 2017) and an estimated 43.1m Americans (US Census Bureau, 2017). This paper explores how university entrepreneurial ecosystems can be expanded to support minority and disadvantaged communities who are under-represented in terms of entrepreneurial activity. Originality/value: Given that there is little research regarding how universities might activate inclusive entrepreneurship initiatives amongst under-represented communities, this paper expands existing knowledge as it identifies the key considerations encompassing university-led community collaborative enterprise support. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the role of public policy in the formation of entrepreneurial ecosystems in Poland. Design/methodology/approach: The paper assumes a qualitative approach to researching and analysing how public policy enables and constrains the formation of entrepreneurial ecosystems. The authors conducted a series of focus groups with regional and national policy makers, enterprises and intermediaries in three Polish voivodeships (regions) – Malopolska, Mazowieckie and Pomorskie. Findings: The paper finds that applying the entrepreneurial ecosystems approach is a challenging prospect for public policy characterised by a theory-practice gap. Despite the attraction of entrepreneurial ecosystems as a heuristic to foster entrepreneurial activity, the cases highlight the complexity of implementing the framework conditions in practice. As the Polish case demonstrates, there are aspects of entrepreneurial ecosystems that are beyond the immediate scope of public policy. Research limitations/implications: The results challenge the view that the entrepreneurial ecosystems framework represents a readily implementable public policy solution to stimulate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial growth. Insights are drawn from three regions, although by their nature these are predominantly city centric, highlighting the bounded geography of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Originality/value: This paper poses new questions regarding the capacity of public policy to establish and extend entrepreneurial ecosystems. While public policy can shape the framework and system conditions, the paper argues that these interventions are often based on superficial or incomplete interpretations of the entrepreneurial ecosystems literature and tend to ignore or underestimate informal institutions that can undermine these efforts. As such, by viewing the ecosystems approach as a panacea for growth policy makers risk opening Pandora’s box. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate challenges of building entrepreneurial ecosystems in peripheral places. The entrepreneurial ecosystem concept is developing a rising popularity among both academics and policymakers in recent years where much of the attention has been put in major urban cities. However, on the way to achieve balanced growth and equity, peripheral places should not be neglected. Thus, this paper links literature on ecosystem with peripheral region studies in creating a conceptual framework of developing entrepreneurial ecosystems in peripheral places. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first reviews literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems and challenges that peripheral places facing in particular. Then, taking into consideration of literature from both fields, a conceptual framework is developed. In order to better illustrate the framework, a case study on Guildford’s digital gaming industry is reviewed based on secondary data. Findings: Though facing various challenges such as smallness, remoteness and lack of resources, peripheral places can take advantage of the digital technology and build an entrepreneurial ecosystem of its own kind through holistic collaborative approach to tackle issues around finance, talents, socio-culture environment, infrastructure, markets and policy. Originality/value: The paper is among the first to focus on developing a holistic conceptual framework in building entrepreneurial ecosystems in peripheral areas. It can lead to a range of further research topics and contribute to develop viable practices particularly for policymakers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the role that public policies may have in re-shaping entrepreneurial ecosystems and supporting the creation of functioning ecosystems based on new forms of finance, i.e. the equity-based crowdfunding. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first identifies and examines the European policies developed to encourage the use of equity crowdfunding in entrepreneurial finance from 2003 to 2018. Then, it reviews national regulatory frameworks for crowdfunding, and analyses the barriers that constrain the growth of national crowdfunding markets. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of regulatory harmonisation by underlining its importance in building an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on crowdfunding. Findings: Building an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on crowdfunding requires better policy coordination between European countries and readiness to take concerted actions. National authorities must look at the crowdfunding phenomenon from a European perspective and align their policies. European policymakers must import best practices from thriving national ecosystems by implementing less bureaucratic policies and with greater impact on entrepreneurial activity. Social implications: In a post-crisis economy, the architecture of entrepreneurial ecosystems must evolve and focus on new financing alternatives ensuring the survival of successful businesses. Originality/value: The paper offers a new perspective on entrepreneurship looking at the formation and development of new ecosystems around equity crowdfunding platforms. It also provides a relevant starting point for subsequent studies into this field. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Since the limited growth of enterprises has been identified as a deliberate choice of women entrepreneurs, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the institutional environment of an entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) fosters the gender gap in entrepreneurial growth intention. The mediating role of the perceived institutional environment in the gender effect on entrepreneurial growth intention is tested in the Chinese context. As individuals’ cognitions are usually influenced by their cultural orientations, the gender difference in perceptions of the institutional environment is considered to be contingent on entrepreneurs’ self-construal. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multiregional sample of 206 Chinese entrepreneurs who completed the questionnaire, the study obtained results by adopting a structural equation modelling analysis with a partial least squares approach. Findings: There are significant gender gaps in perceptions of the institutional environment and growth intention among Chinese entrepreneurs. Due to their limited political ties and lower legitimacy in economic activities in the country, Chinese women entrepreneurs have more negative perceptions of the regulative and cognitive institutional environment than their male counterparts, which accounts for the lack of growth ambition among Chinese women entrepreneurs. Independent self-construal enlarges the difference in environmental perceptions between male and female entrepreneurs. Originality/value: This research enriches the discussion in the emerging area of EEs by adequately responding to the highlighted target to advance ambitious entrepreneurship and offering an interpretation of its evolutionary thinking. Given the increasing calls for a focus on high-growth women’s entrepreneurship, this study provides an explanation for how the institutional environment engenders the absence of women in growth-oriented entrepreneurial activities. It also uncovers the overlooked deficiency in institutional practice by highlighting the gender inequality in the implementation process of entrepreneurial support policies and the distribution of entrepreneurial capabilities in society. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide an extended model of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and examine how institutional infrastructure and two social factors – peer effect and gender discrimination – determine entrepreneurial intention in emerging economies such as India. Design/methodology/approach: Using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, the proposed model is tested on a sample of 265 post-graduate students from the Indian Institute of Management campuses in India. Perceived gender discrimination is used as a grouping variable to test its impact in the model. Findings: The study found that peer effect has positive association with an individual attitude towards entrepreneurship. It also found positive moderating effect of institutional infrastructure on entrepreneurial intention in a regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, but in case of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, the result is non-conclusive. Further, our results establish that gender discrimination has varying influence but remains a significant factor to choose entrepreneurial career in emerging countries such as India. Research limitations/implications: The study adds to the understanding of drivers or antecedents to entrepreneurial intention, especially in emerging economy context and finds its usefulness in country such as India. It contributes to the existing model by empirically proving the role of peer effect and institutional infrastructure in emerging economies which are characterised by weak institutions and inadequate access to resources to start and sustain any entrepreneurial activity. Practical implications: The results make several implications for academic institutions, entrepreneurial ecosystem stakeholders and policy makers in emerging economies. The academic institutions, universities and incubation hubs can consider promoting a peer-group culture that strengthens individual’s EI in emerging economies. Policy makers and stakeholders should build an encouraging entrepreneurial ecosystem with adequate institutional infrastructure to promote entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The authors extend research on entrepreneurial intention beyond individual factors (personal-level variables) and examine the contingent role of institutional infrastructure and socio-cultural factors (peer effect and gender discrimination). Whilst TPB successfully predicted entrepreneurial intention in Western settings, this study provides strong empirical evidence to this research in emerging countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Today's dynamic and complex environment means that companies are trying to develop entrepreneurial thinking as a competitive advantage. Universities around the world are simultaneously increasing entrepreneurial training across a broad array of majors. However, the entrepreneurial training is not heavily connected to industry needs. This paper focuses on how industry and universities can cooperate to prepare students for corporate entrepreneurial thinking. The research is based on extensive literature, reports, and in-depth interviews with 28 people from various parts of the RTP (Research Triangle Park), including companies, government agencies, and numerous programs at multiple universities. The major finding from this study is that the strength of entrepreneurial education in the regional innovation system reinforces the companies' open innovation capacity and their performance. To be successful at launching campus-wide entrepreneurship education to increase understanding of corporate entrepreneurship, Corporate Entrepreneurship Education (CEE) must include (1) entrepreneurial leadership; (2) faculty champions; (3) student-focused policies; (4) engagement with the community; and (5) a decentralized, autonomous structure of entrepreneurship programs. © 2019 by the authors.

Digital startups launching original value propositions can test out and validate their business model using a recent and emerging set of practices known as Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs), which consist of Customer Development and the Lean Startup. While LSAs are gaining momentum in the ecosystem surrounding digital startups, they still suffer from poor theoretical foundations and operational issues that hinder their adoption and implementation. The aim of this study is to go beyond recalling anecdotal and single-case examples and, through mixed-methods research involving 227 digital startups, provide a first large-scale analysis of: (i) if and how digital startups apply Lean Startups Approaches; (ii) the ensuing results; (iii) the main advantages and disadvantages that stem from adopting and implementing LSAs; and (iv) how digital startups connect and combine the LSAs with other entrepreneurial approaches and tools for launching startups. The findings reveal that most of the sample has adopted LSAs and obtained several benefits from their use. A list of practical guidelines on how to solve the existing drawbacks and enhance the effectiveness of adopting and implementing LSAs is hence proposed. To conclude, a framework for organizing the empirical findings is put forward, where LSAs are inserted into the entrepreneurship theory debate on Effectuation, Entrepreneurial Bricolage and Opportunity Creation. Suggestions are then provided on how to sequence and bridge effectuation and causation logics and decision-making tools in an “entrepreneurial opportunities space”. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study uses institutional theory and the “Technopolis” wheel to investigate the movement of technology entrepreneurs and why they “stick” to well-established entrepreneurial ecosystems in Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston, and New York City. We detail the historical development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in each location, with a particular focus on the institutions and support structures that link and sustain key resources that are central to technology clusters. We operationalize key segments of the Technopolis wheel including (1) networks and connectedness, (2) investment capital, and (3) innovation and R&D. The empirical analysis specifies models testing for location-specific variation in the influence of these factors on entrepreneur location choice. We supplement this with analysis of interview data from 45 technology entrepreneurs with direct experience in these locations. We find that higher degrees of connectedness in Austin and Silicon Valley are an important factor in retaining potential entrepreneurs and several institutions were linked to facilitating tie formation and accessing key resources within the Technopolis. We also find that the frequency of funding opportunities positively influences entrepreneurs moving to Austin, Boston, and Silicon Valley to immediately start a company. In Boston, we find a positive association between patents and staying in Boston to launch a startup and we find that older entrepreneurs living in New York and Silicon Valley are less likely to remain and start a company. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a conceptual framework derived from Knorr-Cetina's (1999) theory of Epistemic Culture (EC) and uses it to catalogue and explore what she described as the “machineries of knowing”. The conceptual framework is explicated via empirical analysis of a case of an emergent group of collaborative economy entrepreneurs (CEEs) and their ventures operating in the tourism industry. Based upon qualitative interviews with property owners/managers as CEEs, this study builds further upon an a-priori proposed typology of EC Machineries of Knowing (MOK) and then explores the possible influence of such MOKs upon participating entrepreneurs. The exploration of ECs in the particular setting of the collaborative economy focusses attention upon how epistemic cultures form a specific entrepreneurial ecosystem and how they inter-relate with typologies of entrepreneurs. This fresh conceptual approach is shown to have good explicatory qualities that are capable of unlocking the “black box” that is collaborative economy entrepreneurship. © 2019 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION

Accelerator programs are an increasingly important part of entrepreneurial ecosystems. While accelerators have core defining features—fixed-term, cohort-based educational and mentorship programs for startups— there is also significant variation amongst them. In this paper, we relate key variation in the antecedents, organizational design and operation of these programs to theories of firm-level entrepreneurial performance. We then document descriptive correlations between these design elements and the performance of the startups that attend these programs. In doing so, we probe the connections between design and performance in ways that integrate previously disparate research on accelerators and expand our understanding of startup intermediaries. Our findings delineate the building blocks as well as an agenda for future researchers to build upon not only our understanding of accelerators, but also our understanding of what new ventures need to survive and flourish. © 2019

Corporate accelerators (CAs) are a fast-emerging form of corporate engagement with startups. Equating them with independent startup accelerators and/or corporate venturing limits our understanding of how and why corporations run CA programs and to what end. In this inductive grounded theory study, we explore how corporations design and run CAs and to what effect. This study of four CAs reveals that corporations manage accelerators via one of two distinct processes: namely, accelerating strategic fit or accelerating venture emergence. Our inductive models of these corporate acceleration processes provide new insights into how CAs operate within corporations. Strategic posture and investment time horizon influence corporations' choice of acceleration path and their identification of potential ventures for acceleration. Our study deconstructs what comprises the core corporate acceleration processes and explains how the two pathways result in distinct outcomes—nurturing innovations or nurturing ecosystems. We believe these findings can open up rich research opportunities for understanding how corporations engage with entrepreneurial ventures to enhance their entrepreneurialness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Scholars note the importance of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in promoting new venture activity. Yet to date, limited focus has been given to its impact on female venturing. Accordingly, our study investigates if the entrepreneurial ecosystem influences the prevalence of male and female entrepreneurship over time. We analyze the effect of entrepreneurial ecosystems in 75 countries between 2001 and 2014 on the rates of entrepreneurship for men and women using aggregate data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Adult Population Survey and National Expert Survey. Findings indicate that the prevalence in entrepreneurship is highest for women when the entrepreneurial ecosystem features low barriers to entry, supportive government policy towards entrepreneurship, minimal commercial and legal infrastructure, and a normative culture that supports entrepreneurship. Conversely, we find that prevalence rates for men are highest when there is supportive government policy but weak government programs aimed towards business creation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study investigates the effects of venture typology, race, ethnicity, and past venture experience on the social capital distribution of women entrepreneurs in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Social network data from two municipal ecosystems in Florida, USA (Gainesville and Jacksonville), suggest that network connectivity and the distribution of social capital are significantly different for men and women entrepreneurs. This difference is contingent on the venture type. Male entrepreneurs show higher comparative scores of bridging social capital in aggressive- and managed-growth venture networks, while women entrepreneurs surpass their male counterparts’ bridging capital scores in lifestyle and survival venture networks. Lastly, experienced women entrepreneurs that self-identified as white showed a higher degree of network connectivity and bridging social capital in the entrepreneurial ecosystem than less experienced non-white female entrepreneurs. Implications for entrepreneurship practice and new research paths are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Despite the significant role played by serial entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial process, we know little about group differences in reentry decisions after business failure. Using an ecosystem framework and stigma theory, we investigate the variance in gender gaps related to the reentry decisions of 8171 entrepreneurs from 35 countries who experienced business failures. We find evidence of persisting gender gaps that vary across ecosystem framework conditions of public stigma of business failure and public fear of business failure. Our findings shed new light on ecosystem inefficiencies that arise from multiple interactions between entrepreneurs and institutions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This paper focuses on women’s entrepreneurship policy as a core component of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We use a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to critically explore the policy implications of women’s entrepreneurship research according to gender perspective: feminist empiricism, feminist standpoint theory, and post-structuralist feminist theory. Our research question asks whether there is a link between the nature of policy implications and the different theoretical perspectives adopted, and whether scholars’ policy implications have changed as the field of women’s entrepreneurship research has developed. We concentrate on empirical studies published in the “Big Five” primary entrepreneurship research journals (SBE, ETP, JBV, JSBM, and ERD) over a period of more than 30 years (1983–2015). We find that policy implications from women’s entrepreneurship research are mostly vague, conservative, and center on identifying skills gaps in women entrepreneurs that need to be “fixed,” thus isolating and individualizing any perceived problem. Despite an increase in the number of articles offering policy implications, we find little variance in the types of policy implications being offered by scholars, regardless of the particular theoretical perspective adopted, and no notable change over our 30-year review period. Recommendations to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem for women from a policy perspective are offered, and avenues for future research are identified. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: Although scholars have investigated how social entrepreneurs create and develop social enterprises in the penurious stable environment, how they are created in the penurious unstable environment has yet been overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by exploring how internally displaced individuals, despite the lack of resources, create and develop a social enterprise to serve the other displaced population in the war and conflict zones. Design/methodology/approach: Underpinned by a biographical research design, in-depth interviews with internally displaced individuals who have created social enterprises in the war and conflict zones were undertaken. Three social entrepreneurs were chosen for this study from three different social enterprises that are created by internally displaced individuals to serve the other internally displaced people of three different countries, namely, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. Findings: The single and cross-case analysis found that internally displaced individuals deploy bricolage strategy, for example, reconfiguration of pre-existing resources and competencies (both internal and external), to start up a social venture in the war and conflict zones. They utilise pre-existing internal resources, mainly human capital, and external resources, through a frugal approach towards resources acquisitions. The authors also found that the displaced social entrepreneurs utilise resources of other displaced individuals, for example, networks, volunteers, local knowledge and financial supports mainly from older arrivals, and develop their own enterprise ecosystem within the host location to co-create and co-develop social enterprise and social values for all of them. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that internally displaced individuals utilise bricolage strategies to create and develop socially entrepreneurial venture to serve other internally displaced individuals in the war and conflict zones. As the findings are based on three case studies, for confirmatory approach, a quantitative study with a large sample size is necessary. Furthermore, as the differences in economic, cultural and linguistic in between the home and host locations can have impact on the creation and the development of a social venture, they should be considered in the future studies. Originality/value: This study contributes to the limited literature and studies on social entrepreneurship, specifically, to the context of unstable penurious environment. It also contributes to the literature on bricolage by extending its application from penurious stable environment to the penurious unstable environment. By exploring what and how internal and external resources are utilised to create and develop a socially entrepreneurial venture in a war and conflict zones, this study has added value to the literature on not only bricolage but also entrepreneurship in war and conflict zones. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), the set of forces that generate and sustain regional entrepreneurial activity, are a growing focus of scholars and practitioners. Studies are beginning to draw attention to the role of cultural artifacts, including narratives, in the functioning of EEs. However, the mechanisms driving narratives’ effects on ecosystem participants are unexamined. The purpose of this article is to develop theory that explains the influence of EE narratives on how information is processed by audiences. It is theorized that differences among ecosystems can, in part, be explained by differences in the properties of the narratives that take hold in them. Specifically, propositions are developed about four properties that represent sources of variation among ecosystem narratives: their ability to capture attention, influence the cognitive and emotional encoding of information, and be memorable. Further, it is argued that the maturity of the EE influences the novelty and potency of narrative effects. By integrating theories of cognitive and social psychology, narrative theory, and entrepreneurship, this article advances our understanding of how narratives about EEs influence audiences. © The Author(s) 2018.

This study aims to analyze the entrepreneurship ecosystem at university. The research uses a qualitative approach with a type of exploratory research. Data sources were obtained through in-depth interviews, observations, and documents related to the object of this research. The results of the study show that there are several components of the entrepreneurial ecosystem that can support the growth of new entrepreneurs in universities, including business incubator centers, the establishment of entrepreneurship centers, independent entrepreneurship programs, impact entrepreneur programs, entrepreneurial student development, and entrepreneurship priority. Several strategies are implemented to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem in universities, including curriculum policies, improving the quality of lecturers, accelerating downstream research products, cooperation with other institutions, and providing best entrepreneurship. However, from some of these components, there are those whose roles are still not optimal, namely: Curriculum application, the role of business incubator centers, the collaboration between faculties, and collaboration with banking institutions. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

This study examines the progress of the two major universities in the Caribbean country of Trinidad and Tobago towards the transition to entrepreneurial universities through incorporating the core components of designing and delivering entrepreneurship education programmes, establishing effective university-led business incubators and the building of university–industry–government collaboration. The theoretical construct of the Triple Helix interrelationships and the development stages framework provide the basis for analysing the progress of the universities towards achieving their development mission. The general conclusion is that progress towards building an effective university-centred entrepreneurial ecosystem has been relatively slow and needs to be accelerated through more proactive leadership and greater involvement of internal and external stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2019.

Our study addresses a popular question in entrepreneurship research-to what extent does the quality of a region's entrepreneurial ecosystem matter for venture survival? To tackle this question, we created a regional entrepreneurial ecosystem quality index based on five key characteristics: supportive entrepreneurial culture, access to finance, availability of human capital, innovation capacity, and formal support organizations. We analyze 301 United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas for these characteristics and measure the aggregated contextual influence on venture survival within these regions over time. In addition to analyzing the relationship between this index and venture survival, we also consider the moderating role of founders' experience on survival outcomes. Our findings confirm that, in general, higher quality ecosystems shelter ventures, while ventures in weaker ecosystems are more likely to fade away and fail. However, for serial entrepreneurs, we find that ecosystem quality has a much smaller impact on venture survival. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Accelerator programs constitute an important new element in entrepreneurial ecosystems, comprising focused support to advance the development of entrepreneurial ventures. Yet, we lack understanding of the processes through which accelerators contribute to enhancing entrepreneurial activity and especially the role of entrepreneurship agency in this process. By systematically tracking a cohort of ventures in a leading accelerator, our study draws out intra ecosystem heterogeneity and reveals that the accelerator program elements can impose a distinctive direct effect on participating ventures but the effect varies as entrepreneurs adopt different approaches to engage other players in the ecosystem. We find that in order to fit in the temporal structure of the accelerator program, entrepreneurs adopt two different strategies to achieve accelerated venture development-acceleration with focus and acceleration with foresight. The effectiveness of these two acceleration strategies are moderated by the approaches to engaging the accelerator offerings for resource acquisition. By developing a theoretical framework of entrepreneurial acceleration in the accelerator setting, we contribute to the specific literatures on entrepreneurial process and accelerators and more generally to the emerging literature on the functioning of entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

This article discusses trends in entrepreneurship education. It aims to discuss key concepts around modern entrepreneurship education and to analyze their applicability to universities in the former Soviet countries. Entrepreneurship education is provided mainly in traditional university setting and through short-term projects (master classes, online courses, seminars, projects, etc.). The main factors that cause changes in entrepreneurship education are low forecastability of long-term economic situation, globalization and digitization of economy. In this regard, education is now considered an individual process that lasts a lifetime and educational structures are forced to discover new dimensions of organizational mobility and business agility to survive and thrive in a highly competitive market. At this point, short-term courses, master classes, and projects will be strongly sought-for; individual approach to course planning, the Bologna Process, and individually selected tools are expected to find growing importance. Aside from this, the so-called design thinking is about to creep into the system of education, which provides a project-based approach to learning. Universities become businessoriented: They firstly produce entrepreneurs and secondly perform entrepreneurial activity, namely create business incubators and science parks, accelerate start-ups, realize technology transfer, collaborate with endowment funds (academic fundraising), create an innovation ecosystem, etc. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Universities play an important role in innovation ecosystems. In addition to developing human capital and advancing technology, they are increasingly expected to participate as economic development partners with industry and local, state, and national governments. Models such as the "Triple Helix" have been advanced to frame the assessment of interactions among academia, industry, and governments that may foster economic development. Such models highlight the boundary-spanning roles of universities and provide a predetermined list of actions universities could take to strengthen their ecosystem. Unfortunately, the flexible and entrepreneurial management of universities required to make this model work has virtually been ignored in the academic literature. We propose the dynamic capabilities framework to guide how universities might manage their innovation ecosystems. We use this framework to analyze the role of the university throughout the ecosystem lifecycle. These concepts are then illustrated with three case studies of universities that have engaged with partners in local economies to launch new industries, fostering entrepreneurship, and revitalize neighborhoods. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Entrepreneurship education aims to provide students with the knowledge, skills and motivation to promote entrepreneurial success in various conditions and areas of business activity. The entrepreneurship education focuses on developing skills that enable in future to define and carry out opportunities. It is important to teach entrepreneurship in an interdisciplinary environment to help students cooperating with representatives from different areas and to interact with people of different levels of education and culture. The organization of such learning environment is a difficult and relevant task. Due to digital technologies, future jobs require more and more various skills. Graduates of higher educational institutions need to acquire the right combination of skills for achieving success in a rapidly changing and interconnected world. Today we are witnessing unique development of Internet technologies, which are often ahead of the intellectual capabilities of the mass consumer. That is why elearning is becoming increasingly relevant and in demand. The need for continuous replenishment and updating of professional knowledge, their actualization at the productive stage of human life is determined by the rate of scientific and technological progress, the transition to the information stage of the development of society, the widespread use of innovative technologies. There is a prerequisite for the formation and development of the category of strategic outsourcing. In contrast to services that are one-time, episodic in nature, the functions of professional support for the uninterrupted operation of individual systems and infrastructure on the basis of a long-term contract are usually transferred to strategic outsourcing. The strategic outsourcing allows not only fundamentally restructuring business processes, but also significantly improving opportunities and perspectives. The objective of this study is to explore the concept of outsourcing in entrepreneurship learning. © 2019, Allied Business Academies. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate experimentation over time in Ontario, Canada with place-based innovation policies to support the development and coordination of entrepreneurial ecosystems on a regional basis across the province. Design/methodology/approach: Tracing the policy learning process and successive adaptations in program design over time, the authors provide a detailed case study of the evolution of the Ontario Network of Entrepreneurs (ONE) from 2003 to the present. Findings: The authors find that the program has evolved in response to regular program reviews that include broad input from ecosystem actors operating at multiple levels within the network, and that intermediaries are key facilitators of inter- and intra-ecosystem linkages. However, program complexity and coordination challenges suggest that place-based innovation policies, such as the ONE, should focus specifically on innovation-intensive entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: These findings make three contributions to the theory and practice of place-based innovation policy. First, these policies are by nature experimental because they must be able to flexibly adapt according to policy learning and practitioner input from a wide variety of local contexts. Second, multilevel interactions between provincial policymakers and regional ecosystem actors indicate that place-based innovation policy is neither entirely driven by “top down” policy, nor “bottom up” networks but is rather a complex and variable “hybrid” blend of the two. Finally, publicly funded intermediaries perform essential inter- and intra-ecosystem connective functions but system fragmentation and “mission creep” remain enduring policy challenges. Originality/value: The paper makes an original contribution to the literature by analyzing the development of entrepreneurial policy support framework and situating the case study in the context of the policy learning process involved in place-based innovation policymaking in North America. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a contextual analysis that helps explain how socio-cultural factors are negatively impacting the evolution of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in a struggling regional economy. Design/methodology/approach: A case study method is used to provide a detailed contextual analysis triangulating primary and secondary data. Findings: This paper provides insight into a region impeded from embracing the benefits of innovation-driven entrepreneurship in fostering economic development. The authors show that socio-cultural factors may be inhibiting the region from having a functional entrepreneurial ecosystem that can support innovation. Specific aspects of culture and social capital weaknesses are identified and insight into the potential causes of these impediments were offered. As well, the paper shows how the fundamental nature of culture may be affecting other elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem from maturing. Originality/value: This paper adds to a small, but growing, body of literature that is illustrating the evolutionary nature of entrepreneurial ecosystems and the significant impact of socio-cultural attributes to that evolution. This paper responds to calls to investigate contexts in which innovation does not thrive and where economic challenges prevail. The value of this research paper is to provide conceptual contributions in a contextual analysis from which other researchers can draw comparisons, insights and inspiration for similar approaches. Despite the abundance of research discussing the importance of culture, there are very few actual case studies showing concrete examples of culture and its influence on a region’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems are a strategy that is designed to nurture economic development by promoting entrepreneurship, small business growth, and innovation. Ecosystems represent a new direction for entrepreneurship research that simultaneously increases knowledge of the complex contextual environments surrounding the entrepreneurship process, while at the same time providing useful contributions to policy debates around the role of high-growth entrepreneurship as a driver of regional economic development. This article reviews the concept evolution; different definitions and factors of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Additionally, it provides approaches of past contributions about entrepreneurial ecosystem. This article contributes to knowledge generation and provides further research directions. This study is an attempt to cover the different articles that exist on the entrepreneurial ecosystems. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

Identifying each organization's connection and contribution to the entrepreneurial ecosystem helps to highlight the gaps and the support needed for a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem. New Brunswick has much work ahead to host a large striving entrepreneurial ecosystem: a place for innovation, entrepreneurship, and collaboration. The key players in the ecosystem could provide educational institutions with entrepreneurial support, such as resource opportunities that can support the growth of young entrepreneurs, generate networks, and ultimately provide mentorship opportunities. Sharing success stories of social enterprises with the community is important; social entrepreneurs hold the potential to solve complex social issues in the community and if they have the availability of a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem for support, the future for a stronger economy and society is distinctly possible. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This research aims to understand how certain mechanisms promote cross-border collaboration strategies (CBCS) in new research and development institutions (NRDIs) and improve their academic entrepreneurship within the Triple Helix. Multiple case studies of NRDIs were conducted by proposing a ‘mission-structure-mechanisms-outcomes’ model with the open innovation concept. The findings pinpoint the important role played by CBCS in helping NRDI construct, a micro-collaborative and academic entrepreneurial ecosystem, and improving academic entrepreneurial performance. The following are the key to form CBCS and improve its entrepreneurial performance: to focus the core mission of NRDI on the research results commercialization, to establish cross-border integration, business incubation system and diversified incentives. Results from these case studies provide new insights into the role played by CBCS of NRDIs for practitioners and policymakers in this field. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

To encourage entrepreneurship, schools and colleges are promoting activities and curricular innovations. Make 'n' Market is one such effort to engage and transform the mindset of the student community. It differs from other entrepreneurship events in its nature as it is not a competition or a workshop or a camp. It is not an idea or business plan generator. It is a celebration of peoples’ entrepreneurial skills requiring participants to conceive and market products thereby promoting making and marketing skills to bridge the gap between engineering and business disciplines. The paper describes the event, provides details of its implementation, documents the profile of participants and showcases the learning outcomes. The event has a transformative effect on the regional entrepreneurial eco-system in the long run. © BEIESP.

Accelerating innovation in clean energy technologies is a policy priority for governments around the world aiming to mitigate climate change and to provide affordable energy. Most research has focused on the role of governments financing R&D and steering market demand, but there is a more limited understanding of the role of direct government interactions with startups across all sectors. We propose and evaluate the value-creation mechanisms of network resources from different types of partners for startups, highlighting the unique resources of government partners for cleantech startups. We develop and analyze a novel dataset of 657 U.S. cleantech startups and 2,015 alliances with governments, firms, research organizations, and not-for-profit organizations from 2008 to 2012 and analyze short-term firm outcomes from the different alliances. Our findings highlight the importance of governmental partners in technology development alliances to catalyze cleantech startup innovation (the patenting activity of cleantech startups increases by 73.7 percent with every additional governmental technology alliance when compared to those startups that did not engage in such alliances) and as quality signals to private sector investors for licensing alliances (private financing deals increase by 155 percent for every additional license from a government organization). Overall, these findings extend the alliance perspectives on innovation, contribute to the emerging research on entrepreneurial ecosystems, and underline the need to develop empirical evidence in different sectors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Universities, as anchor institutions in regional entrepreneurial ecosystems, have embraced university business incubators (UBIs) as part of broader commercialisation programmes nurturing university spin-offs. Yet, by requiring substantial construction or rededication of physical space, UBIs are also part of land redevelopment initiatives, the goals of which often include reshaping or revitalising surrounding communities’ physical and cultural landscapes. The commercialisation literature often overlooks this redevelopment tool role, leading scholars to over-ascribe UBI structure to university commercialisation cultures. Through a case study of two universities in the same region, the article finds that bioscience UBIs act as bridging activities between university research commercialisation and land redevelopment arms. Divergent adoption patterns reflect distinct legal, political and personal relationships with layered political jurisdictions (i.e. each university’s jurisdictional embeddedness), and point to a divide between public and private universities. The work has direct implications for how regions leverage large, place-based assets for regional entrepreneurial development, but also suggests that universities have outsized roles in local – and not just regional – spatial patterns of economic activity. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.

The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Unlike many previous studies, we accomplish this aim by testing the roles of entrepreneurial contexts in stimulating entrepreneurial performance, which is captured by entrepreneurial rate and entrepreneurial innovation. We further investigate their interacting with entrepreneurial attention (EA), measured by Internet search data. This is a national longitudinal study of all OECD countries between 2005 and 2014 based on multisource data. Based on the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) results, the main findings are: (1) R&D transfer and market dynamics are important but negative predictors of both entrepreneurial activities; (2) entrepreneurial finance and taxes or regulations policies have significant positive effects on entrepreneurial innovation only when the entrepreneurship attention is high; (3) also only under the high entrepreneurship attention condition, physical infrastructure and cultural and social norms for entrepreneurship have significant positive effects on total entrepreneurial rate. The findings of this study, besides having important implications for entrepreneurial management and policy, have implications on the research of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, entrepreneurial innovation and attention. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: Given limited research about how artisans become integrated into tourism, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the emergence of artisan entrepreneur–mediators who link artisans to tourism in rural areas and small cities in Portugal. Using social embeddedness as a conceptual framework, this paper views artisan entrepreneur–mediators as existing within an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The paper investigates their role within this ecosystem and how social networks influence the artisan entrepreneur–mediators’ roles in connecting artisans to creative tourism. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on new (2017 and 2018) empirical evidence developed through two rounds of semi-structured interviews of five artisan entrepreneur–mediators. Findings: This paper finds that artisan entrepreneur–mediators in rural areas or small cities take on multiple roles as networking agents who organize and offer creative tourism experiences, providing the missing link between artisans and tourists. An analysis of the nuances of the operations of these artisan entrepreneur–mediators suggests that high levels of social embeddedness within local rural communities are important in order for these neo-rural entrepreneurs to attain their goals. Originality/value: Originality lies in the identification of a gap in artisan entrepreneurship literature in a rural context. It is the first time that a critical analysis of artisan entrepreneur–mediators who facilitate the link between artisans and tourism is carried out in terms of social embeddedness, their roles and connections to creative tourism, and types of community engagement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Entrepreneurship has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Although researchers largely agree the importance of innovation in the process of entrepreneurship, little research explores how the emerging innovation approaches can facilitate the above process. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies on entrepreneurship adopting the open platform strategy in light of the digital evolution. To address this research gap, this study investigates how entrepreneurs can take advantage of the platform-based innovation ecosystem in the entrepreneurial process. First, the study discusses various platform-based innovations for entrepreneurs and elaborates on the implementation with examples and practices. Accordingly, the study demonstrates a framework which categorizes these innovation platforms to fulfill the needs at two pivotal stages of the innovation process (i.e. invention and commercialization) for entrepreneurs. The study also discusses the concerns and issues an innovation platform ecosystem may bring forth for entrepreneurs. Finally, the study proposes a number of topics that merit further research. This study represents the first effort to categorize online platforms and develop an innovation process-based framework of platforms for entrepreneurs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Governments across the globe are eager to foster entrepreneurial ecosystems, yet there is no consensus on what policies to use. We develop a theory about the equilibrium consequences of two canonical types of entrepreneurship policies: policies that encourage entrepreneurs to found new ventures and policies that encourage investors to fund new ventures. We distinguish between a short-term impact on current market activity versus a long-term impact on future activity. Investing in entrepreneurial ventures requires tacit knowledge that is mainly acquired through prior entrepreneurial experience, implying that the supply of capital depends on successful entrepreneurs from prior generations. Recognizing this intergenerational linkage has a profound impact on the market equilibrium and the effect of entrepreneurship policies. Our analysis identifies a rationale for using funding polices. © 2019 INFORMS

Besides Silicon Valley, Israel and here in particular Tel Aviv, is regarded as a particularly successful entrepreneurial ecosystem. The so-called start-up nation Israel has the highest start-up density per capita. With a population of 8.8 million, the number of start-ups amounts to around 6500. In the next few years an annual number of foundations of 1000–1500 new firms is expected. The success factors of this boom include the inspirational environment, the lively atmosphere, the role of the military in the training of skilled workers, the willingness to take risks and a high level of implementation dynamics based on the motto “Just do it!”. The aim of this article is not to portray the sun-drenched Mediterranean city as a blueprint for the start-up ecosystem in the Ruhr area but to explore differences and similarities that may create complementarities, so that both ecosystems may benefit from each other through cooperation. In this context we introduce both regions and take a closer look at the networking activities of the economic development agency Business Metropole Ruhr with Tel Aviv. © 2019, Deutscher Verband für Angewandte Geographie (DVAG).

The so-called blue growth is gaining importance in European policy making since it is expanding its relevance beyond traditional economic sectors to new and rapidly developing ones that present significant potential of innovation. This paper seeks to identify the most important factors that can be driving forces of blue growth, taking the example of Greece that being currently in a post-memorandum era, is obliged, in order to meet its engagements, to accelerate with economic growth in general, by untapping also local and regional blue growth potentials and by using MSP to facilitate the growth of its maritime economy. With the aim to put forward concrete policy proposals to boost and make operational blue growth in Greece in a multi-actor perspective, a field survey was designed and conducted with participating representatives of 24 “development companies” operating at local and regional level, all over the country. The method used was the one of environmental scanning (SWOT analysis, etc.). The survey highlighted the strengths and weaknesses as well as the opportunities, the risks and the many challenges that outline prospects and practical aspects of blue growth in the Greek regional space. The results and key findings of the primary research are discussed, highlighting the most important areas of strategy for promoting blue growth at a local level by the development companies including balancing he protection of the marine environment (ecosystem-based management) and economic growth, safeguarding maritime jobs, promoting entrepreneurial discovery through the Regional Strategy for Smart Specialisation, enforcement of maritime law, promoting biotechnology research and the creation of maritime clusters. Finally, policy proposals are presented to support blue entrepreneurship, which may be one of the cutting edges of the country’s new development model. © 2019, World Maritime University.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore and analyse the barriers entrepreneurs with disabilities (EWD) face when establishing their own enterprises, as well as the supporting factors in starting and running a business. Design/methodology/approach: This is an explorative study. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with ten Hungarian entrepreneurs with physical disabilities or sight-loss, during the summer of 2018. Findings: The paper classifies the barriers and supporting factors, as personal, economic and social. Based on the perceptions of the entrepreneurs, personal characteristics, identity and various types of family support play an important role in becoming entrepreneurs, but the entrepreneurial ecosystem generally is not favourable in Hungary, and there are no special support programmes focussing on EWD. Research limitations/implications: Sample size is a serious limitation: the ten entrepreneurs do not represent in any sense the entire EWD community in Hungary, so the patterns found cannot be considered a generally valid picture. Originality/value: The article contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship and disabilities, especially through the systematic review of the possible barriers and supporting factors and to the existing empirical body of knowledge by shedding light on the barriers and supporting factors in a rarely investigated region, in Central Europe: Hungary. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the role of accelerator programmes in promoting transnational entrepreneurship. Designed to assist the growth of start-ups by providing seed finance and structured entrepreneurship support, these programmes are now a prominent feature in many entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world. Drawing on in-depth qualitative evidence focused on one particular programme, the paper shows accelerators play an important intermediary or ‘brokerage mechanism’ providing start-ups with enhanced relational connections and networks. Transnational entrepreneurs attracted to these programmes are highly focused on exploiting these networks whilst maintaining multiple levels of embeddedness in various contexts to maximize the opportunities afforded by accelerators. While many governments are attempting to replicate accelerators programmes within the public sector, the paper concludes that such attempts may prove problematic within weaker entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

University entrepreneurial ecosystems are increasingly important in facilitating innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities in today’s knowledge-based economies. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the demand side of university entrepreneurial ecosystems regarding the role of the entrepreneurial firm as the key user of university knowledge. We propose that use of university knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial firm performance and that the entrepreneurial firm’s resources and capabilities facilitate its ability to create value from university knowledge. We test our hypotheses on survey data of 3853 knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms from 10 European countries. Our study contributes to an increased understanding of the economic, societal and technological contributions of universities by empirically illustrating the role of firm resources and capabilities as moderators of value in university entrepreneurial ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2019.

This study analyzes the economic impact of MIT alumni-founded companies and highlights the key trends in the MIT entrepreneurial ecosystem between 1950 and 2014. Based on a large-scale survey of all living MIT alumni in 2014, this study is a major update to Roberts and Eesley (2011). It systematically characterizes alumni engagement in the broader innovation ecosystem through not only starting new companies, but also patenting, investing as angel investors, and joining startup firms as early employees. We highlight the role of foreign-born students as entrepreneurs and innovators as well as key trends in the alumni-founded ventures' industry composition, firm performance, and economic impact through job creation and sales. Based on the lessons from MIT in the past 60 years, we discuss various implications for university leadership for designing and implementing educational curricula and programs that address the evolving nature of alumni entrepreneurship and innovation. Lastly, the appendix describes our methodological approach to extrapolating survey results and contributes to the literature on survey-based research methods. © Edward B. Roberts, Fiona Murray and J.

This study attempts to fill the literature gap regarding sustainable entrepreneurship viewed through geographical clustering lenses by examining how institutional factors such as local entrepreneurship and innovation climates, knowledge networks, policies, resource availability, and awareness affect entrepreneurial firm formation in the USA. Drawing from various theoretical views within the interdisciplinary literature on the topic, we develop cross-cluster hypotheses regarding firm formation and geographic clustering of clean-technology companies. We test them using a negative binomial random effects model in a panel sample of US clean-technology startup firms and find general support. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

State support for start-ups and entrepreneurship is increasingly common, with governments worldwide experimenting with different initiatives to support innovative businesses. In this article, we conceptualise and assess the South Korean government’s turn towards supporting entrepreneurship as a manifestation of what we label the entrepreneurial developmental state. Using the case of the Park Geun-hye government’s Creative Economy Action Plan, we assess the effectiveness of South Korea’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, and find that the Plan has contributed to an increase in both the quantity and quality of entrepreneurial activity. We then analyse the perceived effects of the Plan on the evolution of South Korea’s ecosystem, which the private sector consider to be mostly positive. This way, we provide new empirical evidence about the performance of the contemporary developmental state, showing that industrial policy can effectively promote small firms and entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2019, © 2019 Asian Studies Association of Australia.

The purpose of this study is to add to the literature on entrepreneurial university ecosystems by highlighting the ways in which academics engage or decouple in entrepreneurship processes and thereby in the emerging entrepreneurial ecosystem. The study extends our understanding of the emergence of an entrepreneurial university ecosystem by providing an in-depth analysis of a Finnish university campus, investigating how individuals’ perceptions respond to societal and institutional demands for the fostering of entrepreneurship. The findings suggest that education and research are regarded as the highly institutionalized logics of universities, and these logics tend to be maintained since more rewards are associated with them than are associated with the logic of entrepreneurial actions. These competing logics lead to conflicting interests and cause intentional and unintentional decoupling in the adaptation and implementation of entrepreneurial actions in universities. © The Author(s) 2018.

Universities play a strategic role as drivers of regional economic growth. One contribution is the establishment and support of University Spin-off companies (USOs), as a knowledge transfer mechanism, thus contributing to generating entrepreneurial university ecosystems. Recent literature points to this as a promising and emerging research area and policymakers are increasingly investing in universities to facilitate economic growth. This is based partially on the idea that a well-established or successful entrepreneurial university ecosystem automatically leads to the emergence of business ecosystems with subsequent benefits to the region. Using the knowledge spillover theory conceptual lens in combination with a social networks approach, this is explored in the region of Andalusia (Spain), centring on the regional entrepreneurial university ecosystem and in the role of the USOs. By means of a mixed-methods approach, we identified the main actors of the Andalusian entrepreneurial university ecosystem and found how the ecosystem is enacted, using a social network approach, and how the ecosystem promotes an expansive wave effect making the knowledge spillover possible to businesses beyond the entrepreneurial university ecosystem. This study confirms empirically that the USOs are main actors in the entrepreneurial university ecosystem and strengthen knowledge transfer, by relating with other businesses beyond this ecosystem; and expands the emergent ecosystem approach into the field of entrepreneurship. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper focuses on the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a set of interdependent and coordinated factors in a territory enabling entrepreneurship. To date, academic research has failed to produce methodologies for evaluating and comparing entrepreneurial ecosystems from different perspectives that can highlight the underlying factors. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical analysis that discriminates between factors according to their importance. Taking into account these two gaps, the aim of the paper is twofold. First, it proposes the application of an accurate, robust and reliable measurement technique, namely stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA). It considers the variability of weights that can be assigned to the different factors, producing a probabilistic ranking to obtain a comparison among entrepreneurial ecosystems. This ranking is more reliable than a single ranking proposed by the usual composite indices that take into account a single vector of weights. Second, the paper presents a new methodology, SMAA for strategic management analytics and assessment, or SMAA squared (SMAA-S), which detects the relation between entrepreneurial ecosystem factors and growth-oriented start-ups in a territory. The results show that the most relevant entrepreneurial ecosystem factors enabling the birth and activity of high-growth start-ups, and so impacting on technology, economy and society, can be identified in cultural and social norms, government programs, and internal market dynamics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study attempts to develop our understanding of the ecosystem as a complex social construct by advancing a social network perspective. Based on personal interviews we model the entrepreneurial ecosystems of two municipalities through a diverse network of entrepreneurs, investors, and institutional leaders. The two ecosystems were characterized and compared on measures related to the level of connectivity between actors, the existence of social boundaries, the role and position of actors with certain attributes (e.g. women, minorities) and the presence of ties in multiple social contexts (e.g. friend and investor). Our results suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystems consist of different social clusters, forming boundaries along venture type (e.g. high-growth, lifestyle), type of support institution (e.g. university, government agency), gender, race, and ethnicity. High-growth/technology entrepreneurs, for example, were predominantly white, male and strongly connected to technology commercialization and acceleration programs. In contrast, entrepreneurs operating survival ventures are mainly non-white, female and often socially disconnected from the main institutions. We also found differences with respect to network connectivity between stakeholders in both ecosystems. Based on our findings, we draw managerial implications for different stakeholders of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

While the study of personality differences is a traditional psychological approach in entrepreneurship research, economic research directs attention towards the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which entrepreneurial activity are embedded. We combine both approaches and quantify the interplay between the individual personality make-up of entrepreneurs and the local personality composition of ecosystems, with a special focus on person–city personality fit. Specifically, we analyse personality data from N = 26,405 Chinese residents across 42 major Chinese cities, including N = 1091 Chinese entrepreneurs. Multi-level polynomial regression and response surface plots revealed that: (a) individual-level conscientiousness had a positive effect and individual-level agreeableness and neuroticism had a negative effect on entrepreneurial success, (b) city-level conscientiousness had a positive, and city-level neuroticism had a negative effect on entrepreneurial success, and (c) additional person–city personality fit effects existed for agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism. For example, entrepreneurs who are high in agreeableness and conduct their business in a city with a low agreeableness level show the lowest entrepreneurial success. In contrast, entrepreneurs who are low in agreeableness and conduct their business in a city with a high agreeableness level show relatively high entrepreneurial success. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2017 International Union of Psychological Science

Assessing the role of publicly funded scientific research in entrepreneurial ecosystems is of great interest for science and entrepreneurship policy. Knowledge from academic research flows into the private sector through publications, patents, and researcher mobility as well as through direct interactions between founders and researchers at public research institutions (PRIs). New technology-based firms (NTBFs) are generally praised for high innovativeness despite their resource constraints and liability of newness. This study therefore investigates the impact of direct interactions with PRIs on NTBFs’ innovation success. In a large sample of NTBFs in Germany, we find that those firms engaging in such knowledge interactions are more likely to introduce new products and services to the market. The strength of this association, however, depends on interaction persistency, internal R&D and the founders’ academic backgrounds. Non-academic start-ups benefit more from continuous informal interactions if they pursue own R&D, which suggests that absorptive capacity matters. In academic start-ups, higher intensities of both formal and informal interactions are associated with greater innovation likelihood. Moreover, continuous informal interactions complement formal ones in the absence of own R&D activity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

University spin-offs with patents (USOPs) are entrepreneurial ventures created by exploiting research results and inventions. USOPs are characterized with a high growth potential and are capable of attracting external investments. To explore the challenges apparent in the creation of USOPs, we reviewed the existing framework to identify key missing elements. Our study proposes a new framework that incorporates Key elements that enhance the creation of USOPs. The new framework focused on the interactions of elements such as national intellectual property regimes, national university assessments, the local entrepreneurship ecosystems where the universities are located, the entrepreneurial orientations and strategies of universities, and stakeholders as independent variables with USOPs as the dependent variable. There is therefore a need for a critical reflection on national and university policies and strategies to enhance the creation of USOPs. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

In the context of entrepreneurial ecosystems the transformation of inventions to innovations is a crucial measure of success. Yet, the exploitation of inventions stemming from academic or corporate research is not as extensive as we would wish leaving room for improvements. Drawing on the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship we investigate the phenomenon of patent-based investment funds as a new type of intermediary in the knowledge spillover process, which could facilitate the transformation from invention to innovation. Using a qualitative research design we analyze data from 21 expert interviews and complementary archival data. We find common characteristics of funds’ activities which decrease knowledge filters and fill the financing gap in the early stages of technology development. We propose a classification of commercialization strategies and link them to a specific set of invention characteristics. Our insights contribute to the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and to the knowledge filter model by providing empirical evidence for the division of labor between knowledge creator and commercialization agent. This adds to our view on entrepreneurial ecosystems as we shed light on different players in the transition process from invention to innovation and thus enhance our understanding of the multifaceted aspects in such an ecosystem. In addition, we refine the literature on patent-based investment funds by providing a classification of the entire commercialization spectrum used by funds and add to extant theorizing on how the nature of a technology determines its commercialization. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Universities are key actors within the entrepreneurial ecosystems. A positive spillover of their knowledge creation and dissemination activity is the establishment of academic spinoffs. This study is one of the first to investigate the post-entry internationalization of academic spinoffs in terms of international sales. Adopting a conditional difference-in-differences approach, we matched a sample of 508 Italian academic spinoffs established between 1999 and 2014 with 404 comparable non-academic innovative start-ups. We find that university spinoffs are more prone to internationalize than their non-academic counterparts. This result is intrinsic to their affiliation with universities but is also related to the degree of internationalization of the parent university. A two-stage Heckman procedure confirms indeed that university internationalization translates into the internationalization of their spinoffs. This study contributes to different streams of literature, ranging from entrepreneurial ecosystems to academic entrepreneurship and internationalization literature due to the academic spinoffs’ nature of being a phenomenon at the confluence of several research fields. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Public funding of research improves the systemic conditions of entrepreneurial ecosystems. It provides early-stage financing to technologies that form the basis for new products and services. In addition to financial support, instruments as the EC Framework Programmes (FP) facilitate the creation of research networks. By bringing together organisations of various types and geographic origins and increasing the diversity of their interactions, the instrument seeks to accelerate a discovery process in which organisations attempt to bring desired innovations to the market and society. In this paper, we examine the impact of organisational and geographic diversity of partnerships in EU-funded research networks on the commercial potential of their innovations. We explore a sample of 603 collaborative research projects supported by European FPs. We use data from the Innovation Radar, a unique survey database developed by DG CONNECT to assess the innovation outcomes of FP projects in ICT. We show that innovations developed by research networks with a higher organisational diversity have more commercial potential. This finding supports the idea that policies improving systemic conditions of entrepreneurship ecosystems through the creation of institutionally diverse research networks can have beneficial effects on the commercialisation potential of innovations developed in FP projects. In contrast, research networks with a wider range of internationally dispersed research partners are likely to have less innovation potential. This may suggest the existence of coordination and communication difficulties in FP projects where geographic diversity is greater. © 2018, The Author(s).

This study analyzes how regional manufacturing characteristics, i.e., specialization and the size of new manufacturers, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem, i.e., contextual factors driving entrepreneurial actions, impact the rate of new knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms. Its spatial analysis of 121 European regions reveals that the entrepreneurial ecosystem plays a decisive role in supporting KIBS formation rates in territories with a solid industrial fabric. The economic potential of more attractive neighbouring regions can be detrimental to regional KIBS formation rates. The study offers valuable implications on how the entrepreneurial ecosystem can facilitate the interaction between manufacturing and KIBS firms. © 2018, © 2018 Regional Studies Association.

Purpose: The creation of a new venture is at the heart of entrepreneurship and shares parallels with project-based organizing: embedded in an institutional context, founders have to assemble a team that works on specified tasks within a strict time constraint, while the new venture undergoes various transitions. The purpose of this paper is to explore parallels between both streams of research and an increasing projectification of entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based upon a case study of the Berlin start-up ecosystem including the analysis of interviews (n=52), secondary documents, and field observations. Findings: The paper reveals that – shaped by their institutional context – patterns of project-like organizing have become pertinent to the new venture creation process. It identifies a set of facets from the entrepreneurial ecosystems – more specifically different types of organizational actors, their occupational backgrounds, and epistemic communities – that enable and constrain the process of new venture creation in a way that is typical for project-based organizing. Originality/value: This study thus elaborates on how institutional settings enforce what has been called “projectification” in the process of new venture creation and discuss implications for start-up ecosystems. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In pursuit of the beneficial outcomes of entrepreneurship, governments and regional development organisations enact policies to stimulate entrepreneurial activity. A growing focus of policymakers in emerging and developed economies is the promotion of entrepreneurial ecosystems: the interconnected system of forces that generate and sustain regional entrepreneurship. Despite intense interest in entrepreneurial ecosystems, the topic is under-theorised. Studies draw attention to the positive effects of entrepreneurial ecosystems on the creation and functioning of early-stage ventures; however, the specific mechanisms through which ecosystems influence entrepreneurs are not clear. To address this issue, we build on dynamic capabilities theory to create a theoretical framework that identifies a set of forces through which ecosystems influence entrepreneurship. We propose that in vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems entrepreneurs are more able to sense, seize and reconfigure resources and opportunities. Our theory contributes to entrepreneurship research, has implications for policymakers and practitioners, and suggests directions for future studies. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

Entrepreneurship is a vehicle of growth and job creation. Approaches taken to encourage entrepreneurship vary around the world based on cultural norms, market conditions, and economic circumstances. Entrepreneurial ecosystems are generally comprised of the government, which builds rules and regulations to support entrepreneurship, the angel and venture capital industry, which provide necessary startup and growth capital to support entrepreneurship, the financial market, which provides financial incentives and exit routes for startups, and finally the entrepreneurs, who form teams and start companies. In present study, we investigate causal relationships between the conditions of economic efficiency ensuring framework and different macroeconomic effects of entrepreneurship, mediated by the entrepreneurial behavior, in the panel of 97 countries based on factor, efficiency and innovationdriven countries during 2008-2017. Using a MIMIC model, we find that a national efficiencyenhancing framework such as entrepreneurial finance, government policy, government supportive programs, entrepreneurship based education, Research and Development (R&D) transfer, commercial and legal infrastructure, internal market dynamics, internal market burden, physical infrastructure, cultural and social norms, act as stimulants for the entrepreneurial behavior of entrepreneurs. While a superior level of entrepreneurial behavior generates simultaneous and/or medium-term favorable effects on the growth of gross domestic product, exports, imports and employment. Therefore, besides immediate growth, assure sustainable economic and social progress in the analyzed countries. Our result also confirms previous findings of other empirical studies in the field. These findings are consistent with received economic theorizing on how national context affects entrepreneurial activity. © 2019, Allied Business Academies. All rights reserved.

Although research on entrepreneurial attitude and intention has received so much attention from scholars, only few studies have investigated the effect of value, usefulness, and pleasure associated with business simulation games, and how these values affect students’ attitude and intention toward entrepreneurial activities. In this study, Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior have been used in combination to explore how these technological teaching methods influence the attitude and intentions of the students toward entrepreneurial activities. The results show that all hypotheses have been proven by stating significant and positive students’ attitude and intention toward entrepreneurial activities using business simulation games. But subjective norms did not contribute toward student intentions in this regard. It is concluded that people with high uncertainty avoidance are reluctant to take the risk; therefore, there is a need to change their attitude by implementing entrepreneurial ecosystem in society. © The Author(s) 2018.

This paper builds on institutional theory to understand the role that the institutional environment plays in emerging economies which encourage citizens to create Internet of Things (IoT)-based interventions. The research included a field-based study in Hyderabad, a south Indian smart city, using a qualitative explorative research methodology. The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out’ situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The role of entrepreneurial ecosystems in fostering economic growth has become a key priority around the globe. To develop such ecosystems, numerous countries have provided significant inducements to multinational enterprises (MNEs) to attract them to locate their operations within their borders. Despite the rise in MNEs’ entry, evidence on their efficacy in invigorating local entrepreneurial systems has been mixed. We propose that this may arise from a lack of focus on local ecosystems’ absorptive capacity, which is essential to spawning different types of entrepreneurial ventures that combine both replicative (imitative) and truly innovative local firms. This occurs as local entrepreneurs in proceed to capture, assimilate, and exploit MNEs’ different knowledge spillovers. Further, we argue that the dynamic interplay between knowledge flows through spillovers from MNEs and absorptive capacity is likely to promote the emergence, evolution, and sustainability of different types of new local firms—in some cases creating conformity and lock-ins and in others enhancing the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial activities. Over time, these developments encourage co-specialization between local new ventures and MNEs. Our analyses highlight key sources of heterogeneity in types of new firms that might emerge in a local ecosystem and how they might develop over time as a result of MNEs’ entry, creating wealth. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The “entrepreneurial ecosystem” metaphor is capturing attention in academia, industry, and government. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach is used in corporate, national, or local contexts, and has grown in prominence given the vital need to transform economies around the creation of innovative ideas, products, services, and technologies. Entrepreneurial ecosystems involve a network, a system, of interactions of individuals and organizations, like financial intermediaries, universities and research institutions, suppliers and customers, multinational companies, or the government. The entrepreneurial ecosystem literature has thus mainly focused on identifying the relevant stakeholders like entrepreneurial firms and entrepreneurs and how they interact with other stakeholders within a more or less defined system. Despite the popularity of the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach, the literature has almost overlooked and largely ignored the governance of entrepreneurial ecosystems. This special Issue of Small Business Economics critically examines issues concerning the governance of entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This paper investigates the interplay among three main elements of an entrepreneurial ecosystem: local universities, local financial system, and residents’ individual attitudes. Specifically, we study how the local availability of university knowledge interacts with the relative presence of cooperative banks in the local banking industry and with the residents’ tendency to behave opportunistically to determine the creation of high-tech ventures in a territory (i.e., Italian provinces). Our insight is that high information asymmetries impede high-tech entrepreneurial ideas based on university knowledge to attract external finance. Cooperative banks, which have trust-based relationships with the local community, are potentially a valuable source of finance for these entrepreneurial ideas, but are restrained by their inherent risk aversion. Accordingly, we argue that university knowledge and local presence of cooperative banks can interact either positively or negatively in determining the creation of high-tech ventures at the local level. We also contend that residents’ individual attitudes shape this interaction as trust-based relationships are more valuable in areas where residents tend to behave opportunistically. In the empirical part of the paper, we estimate zero-inflated negative binomial regressions where the dependent variable is the number of new high-tech ventures established in 792 province-industry pairs in the period 2012–2014. In line with our reasoning, we find that in provinces where residents tend to behave opportunistically, the relative presence of cooperative banks magnifies the positive effect of university knowledge on high-tech entrepreneurship. Conversely, this effect is negligible in provinces with less opportunistic residents. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

In this paper, we examine how one important type of relationship, research joint ventures (RJVs), is governed within the context of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Based on agency theory, we investigate the relationship between the governance structure of an RJV and the likelihood that the venture will embrace elements of its research-based ecosystem, that is, the likelihood that the RJV will invite a university to become a research member of the venture. Using data from the National Research Joint Venture Database, we find that when the governance structure of the RJV affords the organizer/leader and research director (the principal) the ability to exert control over the activities of the other members of the RJV (the agents), universities are less likely to be invited to participate as a research member. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We argue two alternative routes that lead entrepreneurial start-ups to acquisition outcomes instead of liquidation. On one hand, acquisitions can come about through the control route with external financers such as venture capitalists (VCs). VCs take control through their board seats along with other contractual rights that can bring about changes in a start-up necessary to successfully attract a strategic acquirer. Consistent with this view, we show that VCs often replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO long before an acquisition exit. On the other hand, acquisitions can come about through more advice and support provided to the start-up, such as that provided by an incubator or technology park. Based on a sample of 251 Crunchbase companies in the USA over the years 2007 to 2014, we present evidence that is strongly consistent with these propositions. Further, we show a tension between VC backing of start-ups resident in technology parks insofar as such start-ups are slower to become, and less likely to be, acquired. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

While the metaphor of entrepreneurial ecosystem has become popular in academia, industry and government, one aspect is almost neglected, the role of universities. In particular, there is a paucity of studies that examine the governance of universities in relation to their engagement within the ecosystem. This paper relates for the first time the governance structure of universities to their capacity to foster the establishment of academic spin-offs. Thanks to a regulatory change imposing to Italian State universities the enrollment of lay members (i.e., external directors) in their board of directors, we can observe their appointment as an exogenous shock. We find that, while half of the universities appoint the minimum required number of lay members, others appoint more, up to creating board of directors where only the rector is not external. Moreover, there is a strong variety in the type of experiential capital that these lay members bring to universities. While some are entrepreneurs or managers of private firms, others are local stakeholders, such as lawyers or members of foundations or chambers of commerce. Such variance is reflected in the stimulus they exert on the creation of spin-offs. Using a regression discontinuity design on a sample of 1234 spin-offs from 66 universities, our longitudinal study of 1122 university-year observations shows that the rate of establishment of technology spin-offs increases more when more entrepreneurs are appointed. Local stakeholders in the university’s board of directors, by contrast, are associated with increased establishments of service-oriented spin-offs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate an entrepreneurship training and education programme, which has already had five editions in the Sabor region of Portugal’s northern interior. This evaluation was conducted in order to propose new guidelines to improve the Sabor Entrepreneurship Programme (SEP). Design/methodology/approach – The research included primary data collection using mixed methods (i.e. quantitative and qualitative). Questionnaires were distributed to 103 entrepreneurs who participated in the SEP, and interviews were conducted with entities involved in developing this programme. The data were processed using cross-sectional content analysis of the interviews and descriptive analysis of the completed questionnaires in order to ascertain the opinions of all the parties involved in the SEP. Findings – The results show that the SEP has been modified throughout the five editions, which has contributed to better performance. Based on the findings, new guidelines were proposed for the programme, such as the implementation of new phases and improvement of various methods used. The proposed phases include the validation and full development of business ideas, management decision training for entrepreneurs, help with financing solutions and support during new companies’ first three years. The results also indicate that the SEP needs to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that includes public policies and the involvement of other local entities that are active in the region and that have the skills entrepreneurs need. Originality/value – This study’s findings have theoretical and practical implications, which provide empirical evidence of how evaluating entrepreneurship education and training programmes can make them more effective and efficient. In addition, the results contribute to the evolution of the existing knowledge about entrepreneurial ecosystems. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

The traditional way in which universities may influence the entrepreneurial intention of students is through the offering of entrepreneurship education programs. Researchers have been studying the impact of entrepreneurship education programs on entrepreneurial intention of students for several years. There is also evidence in the literature that the university’s environment and support system are additional ways of motivating students to consider an entrepreneurial career after graduation. The aim of this study is to understand the influence of the university’s environment and support system on the precursors of entrepreneurial intention of students at Memorial University. Situational and contextual variables typically have an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intention by influencing key attitudes and general motivation to behave. This study applies a customized entrepreneurial intention model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior to understand the precursors of intention to start a new business. Another goal of the study is to develop a methodology to study the evolution of the motivational factors related to university’s ecosystem that may shape entrepreneurial intention of students over time. The proposed methodology is also relevant to other aspiring entrepreneurial universities hoping to play a more prominent role in the economic development of their communities. Findings of the study agree with those reported by previous authors in that, Memorial University’s ecosystem has a significant positive relation with students’ perceived behavioral control. However, findings of the study also suggest that Memorial University’s ecosystem has a positive but not significant influence on students’ attitude towards the behavior of starting a new business. The outcomes of the study will help Memorial University to assess the efficacy of its innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives in promoting entrepreneurial activities. By understanding its entrepreneurial efficacy, the university will be better equipped to raise the perceptions of venture feasibility and desirability, thus increasing students’ perceptions of opportunity. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Purpose: Entrepreneurial ecosystems, the inter-connected set of organizing forces that produce and sustain regional entrepreneurial activity, are receiving heightened attention. This research finds that narratives about ecosystem participants discursively construct entrepreneurial ecosystems. However, the studies do not emphasize ecosystem and region-level narratives, focus on ecosystems in which narratives are uncontested and, thus, do not examine how ecosystem narratives compete with other regional narratives. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory that explains how narratives and entrepreneurial ecosystems emerge and change in response to existing regional narratives. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal process model is proposed to explain how entrepreneurial ecosystem narratives emerge and compete with other regional narratives. To illustrate the phases of the model, archival data were collected from three entrepreneurial ecosystems where new narratives have had to overcome entrenched economic and cultural narratives. Findings: It is theorized that entrepreneurial ecosystems emerge, in part, through discourse. For an entrepreneurial ecosystem to develop, a narrative must take hold that allows participants to make sense of the new entrepreneurial activities and the changes to the region. A four-phase process model is presented to explain how entrepreneurial ecosystem narratives compete with other regional narratives and, particularly, negative economic narratives. Originality/value: The theory developed in this paper contributes to the research on entrepreneurial ecosystems and organizational narratives and generates practical implications for policymakers and entrepreneurs seeking to promote entrepreneurship as a tool for economic development. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Diaspora entrepreneurs contribute to regional development through business, ideas and resources. Most diasporas originate from migration from developing and emerging economies and are captured in dyadic patterns between the country of origin and their residence. Understudied are diaspora entrepreneurs migrating ‘against the tide’ by selecting atypical destination region(s). This qualitative study examines the migratory paths of Jewish diaspora entrepreneurs departing from their communities and planting seeds at new locations for their communities to follow – in other words, leaving their communities behind physically, not mentally. Findings advance a theoretical understanding of diasporic entrepreneurial types, contexts and the dynamic interplay between pioneering entrepreneur(s), their community and their location. © 2018, © 2018 Regional Studies Association.

What kinds of places have high entrepreneurial activities? There has been an emerging body of studies about so-called entrepreneurship ecosystems, but virtually all of the past studies have examined this question from a perspective of which metropolitan areas have higher entrepreneurial activities. In this article, we examine the intrametropolitan scale at the Census tract level. By analyzing thirty metropolitan areas to extend external validity, we demonstrate the concentration of high-growth firms in specific employment nodes in both urban and suburban parts of each metropolitan area. Significant correlations exist between place-based vibrancy indicators and high-growth firm concentrations. © 2018, © 2018 American Association of Geographers.

While the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems is now a prominent topic and an important stream in entrepreneurship research, the question of how ecosystems can specifically promote sustainable entrepreneurship and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations is a neglected issue. With the papers in this special issue, we address this research gap, serving as a catalyst sparking more research at the nexus of contextualization of entrepreneurship and sustainability. This research has, since the 1990s, developed in three waves; the explicit linkage to SDGs and the investigation of impacts of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial ecosystems in achieving societal and environmental goals might be considered as the “fourth wave.” We first introduce relevant research streams and concepts for investigating sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. Then, we explain why this special issue and its articles represent a fourth wave in entrepreneurial research (“sustainability”). Thereafter, we provide an overview of the papers of this special issue and then end with a brief consideration of future research demands. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Rural entrepreneurship is considered one of the key driving forces for the development of rural and regional socio-economic systems. I propose to analyse the development of rural entrepreneurship in Russia within the framework of the entrepreneurial ecosystem theory. The article presents the results of studying economic and institutional factors constraining entrepreneurial activity in rural areas. The research, based on a survey of rural entrepreneurs in the Ural region, aimed to identify factors that have the greatest negative impact on the development of rural entrepreneurship. The survey questionnaire was compiled using the Likert scale. The survey was conducted over 10 years; each year a simple random sample of 30 respondents was chosen. Then the data was processed with the help of special software “Strata 11”. The obtained results have demonstrated that the main factors hampering the development of rural entrepreneurship were the lack of qualified workers able to perform innovative types of work (value 4.6), high cost (value 4.6) and high risk of innovative activity (value 4). The most interesting is the dynamic of the “enterprise immunity to innovation” aspect. While in 2007 it was named as one of the main negative factors (value 4.5), in 2017 its value decreased significantly (to 3). I claim, a lot of entrepreneurs incorrectly percept a business development model that is adequate to entrepreneurial ecosystem’s conditions. That misunderstanding leads to efficiency reduction of both certain enterprises and rural entrepreneurial ecosystem in general. The study’s results have both scientific and practical importance for defining a model of rural entrepreneurship development and determining the most effective mechanisms of its support. © 2019 Institute of Economics Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Sustainability and economic growth—the integration and balance of social, environmental, and economic needs—is a salient concern for sustainable development and social well-being. By focusing on a sustainable innovation project, we explore how entrepreneurial ecosystems become sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems and investigate the interactions of entrepreneurial actors. We conducted an inductive, single-case study of a specific collaborative innovation project in the denim industry specialized in a specific geographic location. From our data, we show that the presence of four conditional aspects foster sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. These include sustainability orientation of actors, recognition of sustainable opportunities and resource mobilization, collaborative innovation of sustainability opportunities, and markets for sustainable products. We make two observations that contribute to the literature. First, we see that in a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem, entrepreneurial experimentation is a highly interdependent and interactive process. Second, we see that recognition of sustainable opportunities is distributed among different actors in the ecosystem. Our findings also have implications for practitioners and policy-makers. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Many researchers recognise that the entrepreneurial ecosystem is a network, defined as the interaction between the components (actors & factors), but little research has been conducted on the systematic analysis of network properties Although, several systematic literature reviews exist on either entrepreneurial ecosystem or network, but none of them has addressed the specific realm of the research. The purpose of this study is to provide a useful literature map about entrepreneurial ecosystem research especially in determining the position of network theory and also to identify gaps and state-of-the-art in research as well as implications and guidelines for both scholars and practitioners. This paper presented a systematic mapping study that found 206 papers of entrepreneurial ecosystem. These papers were surveyed, analysed and classified according to research focus, research method, paper type, and publication trends that change over time. Analyses of the 206 articles showed that research on entrepreneurial ecosystem with focus on network theory is still limited. The most widely used research method and paper type for this topic are qualitative and philosophical paper type. The trend of publication showed a significant development especially in 2016-2017. Based on the SMS results, it can be a state of the art of entrepreneurial ecosystem research from network theory perspective which is still limited and needed to be explored. © 2019 Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal.

Researchers and theorist have put great effort into defining and examining entrepreneurial ecosystems and how business clusters develop in certain regions. Favourable entrepreneurship ecosystems are thought to drive business and innovation. However, a commonly accepted measure of entrepreneurial ecosystem favourableness has yet to be developed. The purpose of the present research is to contribute to ecosystems research by taking a two-study approach to developing and validating a perceptual measure of entrepreneurial ecosystems. The perceptual measure is based upon prior conceptual frameworks that outline ecosystems. In developing this measure, we are able to further unpack and illuminate the factor structure of ecosystems, the results of which have direct scholarly and practitioner uses. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In spatial terms, entrepreneurial ecosystems are mostly conceptualized as confined to a specific territory. At the same time, the growing relevance of entrepreneurship in digital fields is underlined. This paper argues that this is contradictory since territorial thinking underestimates the disruptive qualities of new entrepreneurial practices in the digital economy. Using process-based, qualitative case studies on seed accelerators from four regions: Amsterdam, Berlin, Detroit and Hamburg, this study seeks to explore knowledge brokering in entrepreneurship ecosystems and analyzes the corresponding spatial dynamics. Our findings imply that startups in digital fields share knowledge about business models and technologies in a way that is unattainable in classical knowledge clusters. Moreover, we show that most of the observed entrepreneurial practices in seed accelerators crucially rely on extra-regional resources and thus remain only incompletely embedded into the respective regions. Against the background of these results, we suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystems should not be primarily viewed as territorial phenomena. Instead, we suggest that the territorial view on entrepreneurship ecosystems should be complemented with a topological view that foregrounds entrepreneurship as a trans-locally shared practice that is tangent to different regions in different ways. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

This paper seeks to expand our understanding of sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems by investigating the interrelation between contextual factors and sustainable entrepreneurial activities of sharing ventures. While the sharing economy is considered as a potential pathway to a more sustainable society,; ambiguous activities of some sharing ventures call the credibility of sharing as a sustainable concept into question. In order to shed light on the underlying cause of the ambiguity, we conducted 37 in-depth interviews with founders and senior managers of sharing ventures. Our comparative analysis identifies two distinct sets of contextual factors, which influence their sustainable activities. The first set of contextual factors enhances sustainable activities by enforcing the adaptation of behavioral rules and by enabling the development of organizational capabilities. The second set of contextual factors restricts sustainable activities by impeding market penetration and by suppressing growth. We contribute to theorizing about sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems by delineating the conjoint effect of contextual factors on sustainable activities. Furthermore, our results add insights into the controversial academic debate about the sustainability dimension in the sharing economy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Theoretical concepts related to entrepreneurial ecosystems are currently in the initial stages of development and components of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystems (U-BEEs) are yet to be clarified or defined. This study identifies elements of U-BEEs and employs an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to analyze university-based venture development organizations (VDOs) as research subjects. This study extracted six elements: namely policy, finance, culture, support, human capital, and market, comprising 31 evaluation indicators. The results of this study indicated that "market" was considered the most crucial of the six elements in Taiwan. Finally, this paper provides theoretical and practical implications based on the aforementioned findings. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

The ecosystem of entrepreneurship includes institutions, notably the market with its arrangements, such as extent of the market and availability of opportunities. In Iran, extent and opportunities were limited by severe sanctions until 2015, when sanctions were eased by what is known as the nuclear agreement. This institutional change invites the hypothesis that easing sanctions entailed an expansion of entrepreneurship. This hypothesis is tested as a natural experiment, comparing entrepreneurial pursuits before and after the agreement, using the annual survey of adults and entrepreneurs in Iran conducted by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, complemented by in-depth interviews. Pre-and post-survey comparisons show increases in people's opportunity perceptions, intention to become entrepreneurs, and entry into entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs became increasingly pulled by opportunity and decreasingly pushed by necessity, increasingly export-oriented, and expectations for growth of businesses increased. These findings contribute to understanding how institutional change in the ecosystem of entrepreneurship can change entrepreneurial pursuits. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The idea of entrepreneurship covers numerous sorts of hierarchical and individual exercises, however it takes its most evident shape in the choice by an entrepreneur to begin a new business. An entrepreneurial ecosystem, in a more extensive sense alludes to the environment influencing the local/regional business enterprise.

While business practices and management research has evolved towards more systemic approaches building on the notion of ecosystem to relate organisations with their complex operational environment, the linear model of innovation is still highly pervasive in governmental innovation policies. In this paper we contribute to the narrowing the research gap in the field on ecosystems by combining two often separate streams of literature and subsequently coining the term ‘entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems’. We then examine the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a recent policy experiment aimed at developing Pan-European ecosystems to stimulate high-impact innovative entrepreneurship, which is done by integrating higher education, research and business activities (i.e. via knowledge triangle integration). While the high political profile of the EIT has constrained partly its freedom to experiment, a European-wide networked excellence and business logic in managing KICs has created new insights on experimental governance models that merit to be explored further. Building on an action research case study, the paper documents these developments and opens up an avenue for further work regarding experimental governance of Pan-European entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems. © 2019, © 2019 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.

The importance of entrepreneurial ecosystems is accentuated in the academic entrepreneurship context since academic spinoffs (ASOs) must rely on actors from the ecosystem to access resources they lack in order to improve their performance. This study analyzes the impact that actors from social and institutional (university and nonuniversity) contexts in the entrepreneurial ecosystem have on ASO performance in the stage of creation and initial development and in the stage of consolidation. From a sample of 118 ASOs in the initial stage and 47 ASOs in the consolidation stage, the results indicate that social and institutional contexts improve the performance of ASOs in both phases of development, although the relevance of each context varies with the stage. In the creation and initial development stage, the institutional context affects the ASOs' performance to a greater extent, while the influence of the social context is less strong. Science parks from the institutional context are the most relevant actors in this phase. In the consolidation phase, social context is the most relevant for improving the performance of ASOs, with the venture capitalist being the actor that exerts more influence. With respect to the institutional context, performance is only affected by the nonuniversity context in this stage. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

The dominant discourse on Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EE) remains focused on the profile of a handful of successful locations. This has hindered a deeper comprehension of the economic mechanisms that shape evolutionary trends in entrepreneurial activity and how they operate in distinct places. We propose that EE have regularities, but they can also assume different configurations, i.e., varying combinations of influential dimensions. Through fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, we address this issue with data from the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This research focuses on five EE dimensions: Science & Technology, Human Capital, Market Dynamics, Business Dynamics, and Infrastructure. Findings point at the heterogeneous nature of EE distributed in three different paths. While configurations' vary in terms of causal conditions, research universities, knowledge-intensive jobs and wider credit operations are core-causal conditions. Proximity to the main economic hub appears as a key differentiator among ecosystems. © RAE.

Purpose: Impact investing, a type of values-based investing that combines financial investment with philanthropic goals, is receiving heightened scholarly and practitioner attention. The geography of impact investing, however, is largely unexamined, and it is not clear why some regional impact-investing communities are more vibrant than other communities. Regional differences in entrepreneurial activities are increasingly explained by differences in the vitality of entrepreneurial ecosystems, the set of interconnected forces that promote and sustain regional entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to leverage insights from entrepreneurial ecosystems studies to understand the dynamics of communities that encourage and support impact investing. Design/methodology/approach: To explain inter-regional differences in the prevalence and intensity of impact investing, this conceptual paper draws from research on entrepreneurial ecosystems and impact investment to theorize about the ecosystem attributes and components that drive vibrant impact investing communities. Findings: It is theorized that vibrant impact investing ecosystems have three system-level attributes – diversity, cohesion and coordination – that are influenced by the core components of the ecosystems, including the characteristics of investors, the presence of social impact support organizations and cultural values that promote blending logics. Originality/value: The theoretical model contributes to research on impact investing and hybrid organizing, produces concrete implications for ecosystem builders and sets an agenda for future research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The creation of a new venture is at the heart of entrepreneurship. Chinese governments at different levels are proactive in promoting the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) and fostering new venture creation (NVC). However, it is still far from clear how governments as focal actors in the EE affect and regulate the process and pattern of NVC. This study borrows from the theory of temporary organization and conducts a comparative case study of two entrepreneurial projects in the Hangzhou Dream Town EE. This study proposes an integrated conceptual framework to illustrate NVC in two dimensions of projectification (the process of NVC) and partnering (a pattern of NVC) and specifies that the main role of local governments is as a sponsor, feeder, and endorser in that order. The three functional roles enable local governments to catalyze the creation of new ventures through projectification and partnering. Our study not only contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship, governance theory, and the theory of temporary organization but also provides an actionable approach for governments to foster new ventures, especially in transition economies such as China. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The Thai gem and jewellery industry employs up to 900,000 people including many women in the formal sector and many more in the informal sector. This contrasts with the limited participation of women in the gem industry in India and Sri Lanka. There is little research into the role of women in the operation of the industry. This research used entrepreneurship ecosystem theory to understand the Thai institutions that support and hinder women in the Thai industry. Interviews were conducted across Bangkok and Chanthaburi and detailed life histories were recorded of women owned businesses in the Jewellery Trade Centre. Thai women are influential in the industry and there are positive workplaces where women can play an important role. Universities and government institutions are key enablers but there is still gendered division of labour with women earning less than men in some sectors. Cultural norms also prevent them from achieving their full potential. Some women are working informally in very poor conditions. As Thailand seeks to become the global gem and jewellery industry leader, it needs to foster an entrepreneurial ecosystem that develops a new generation of gemstone entrepreneurs, especially its women and youth. © 2019

The purpose of this paper is, to propose a methodology for the comparison and ranking of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EEs) in order to offer the decision maker a straightforward way of assessing the competitiveness of national economies. EEs are a coordinated set of individual and institutional agents, on the national level, aimed to pursue economic development through the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Among the various approaches found in EE research, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor consortium evaluates the national economic development of more than 100 countries, concerning both individual and contextual factors. Entrepreneurship Framework Conditions of national EEs are rated on an annual basis by groups of domain experts on a number of predefined criteria. These ratings describe the various facets of the EEs, exposing strengths and weaknesses of the contextual environment, offering a snapshot of the competitiveness conditions of the national economy. However, comparative studies examining the relative performance of each EE, are needed in order to communicate useful information and help stakeholders make insightful decisions and design policy. The ranking of EEs as different alternatives based on multiple criteria is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. The relative importance of each criterion is defined either by experts or by statistical methods. The selection of criteria weights is usually a cumbersome procedure. The utilization of non-weighted or equal weight methods, eliminates the need for definition of weights, it has less computational overhead and can produce distinct and objective rankings of the alternatives. The Greek EE is taken as a working example, and it is compared with a number of developed and developing countries, as alternatives. The consistence of the ranking results produced by the method proposed is compared with the evaluations of other EE metrics and the results of other well accepted MCDM methods. The application of the method produced a distinct ranking for each alternative EE. The Greek EE ranked below average among the countries of the comparison group, implying that it is less conducive for entrepreneurship development, although it is categorized among the most developed Innovation Driven economies. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are thoroughly discussed offering useful conclusions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems provide a rich context for analyzing entrepreneurial outcomes such as new venture growth. In most entrepreneurship research, influence of context or environment is undermined or controlled. Also, most studies consider either macro- or micro-level factors using single-level analysis, which mute the higher-level influences on new firm growth. To overcome these gaps, we empirically consider macro- and micro-level factors together, and their cross-level interactions to portray the nexus of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ecosystem in growth of new independent ventures in the various US metros. Our findings provide interesting insights on the moderating effects of prior experiences of founders on ecosystem attributes and firm growth. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

Academic libraries are increasingly involved in the support of student entrepreneurship on their campuses, both in programming and the curriculum. As the understanding that librarians are a key component for student success as part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem widens, libraries have been adapting and designating various staffing models in response. This chapter includes a literature review of case studies to examine various types of staffing in academic libraries providing support to entrepreneurship and innovation programs. The chapter highlights best practices for each of several staffing models. Potential models range from entrepreneurial outreach done by business librarians, creation of the entrepreneurship librarian position within an institution, how library-owned innovation/incubator spaces are staffed, and other creative models deployed for providing support to the entrepreneurial student. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tech start-ups and their entrepreneurial ecosystems are assuming increasing global attention, particularly from policy makers and empirical researchers, alike. If entrepreneurial ecosystems have to be promoted for an accelerated birth and growth of tech start-ups, it is imperative to understand its structure, essential components and the gaps, if exist. Against this backdrop, this article attempts to ascertain the gap between an ideal ecosystem and the prevailing ecosystems and its causal factors, based on four-stage interactions with ecosystem stakeholders (by means of Delphi technique application) in Bangalore and Hyderabad, in India. The gap analysis is done by means of a hierarchical regression model for five different sets of components of the ecosystem structure, apart from a control (dummy) variable to distinguish Bangalore from Hyderabad. The hierarchical regression analysis substantiated the entrepreneurial ecosystem structure for tech start-ups proposed in terms of relative importance of various sets of components, and ascertained the factors responsible for the ecosystem gap. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Universities have been identified as knowledge creation centres, where knowledge can be created and transferred for social and economic benefits and advancement. What makes them relevant now is that we are in the knowledge era where knowledge has become the currency for facilitating sustainable development; hence, the role of universities, as knowledge creation centres, has become more relevant. This relevance is reflected in their potential to generate ideas and knowledge that can become products and companies when harnessed. The gap, however, has been that a lot of the knowledge created by universities has not gone beyond the idea or prototype stage. This study, thus, proposes a framework to harness knowledge created in and by universities to take them from the concept stage to the product stage and then to the startup stage, hence, making them factories for startup companies. This is essential for harnessing the commercial value of knowledge. This study, therefore, presents a structure on how Nigerian universities can become factories for shipping startup companies that create value, opportunities and wealth, through their entrepreneurial efforts. © IAEME Publication.

The term 'entrepreneurial eco-system' (EES) currently belongs to the most popular ones in economic geography - and in the practice of start-up support policies in many countries, too. Due to its exclusively positive connotations the usage of this term creates unrealistic hopes among entrepreneurship support practitioners. Scholars may be reminded to previous supposed panaceas of regional economic policies like clusters, 'creative class' members or high-tech industries. As for these predecessors as well, the concept is "fuzzy" (Markusen 1999), the available empirics are "scanty" (ibid.) and its perception among policymakers is oversimplified, exclusively positive and partially naïve. To a degree, this is a consequence of an extremely unclear definition of what is meant by an EES. The undertheorization of the EES discourse, as observed by some scholars, is not due to a lack of conceptual approaches per se, but due to a lack of convincing, theoretically strong approaches. In fact, the majority of the EES publications is conceptual or even theoretical, usually without any serious empirical underpinning. From our perspective the latter has one important consequence: EES theory is weak because there is a lack of representative, comprehensive and sophisticated empirical studies, indicators and methods to measure EES. This paper provides a unique attempt to measure EES at the sub-national level of regions, that is, from our perspective, the most appropriate spatial level to identify and measure (and theorize) EES as the regional entrepreneurship literature provides striking evidence in favor of entrepreneurship as being primarily a regional (or local) event. Our paper contributes to the current EES debate by arguing that a robust empirical measurement of various EES at the sub-national level may help to improve the quality of EES theory. We propose to start with Erik Stam's interpretation of an EES based upon ten "conditions" for whom we develop specific variables for application in concrete data collection exercises in different regions. We develop an overall EES index as well as subnational indices for each of the ten conditions. We also propose a method to care for the various weighting problems to be solved. Our attempt has been successfully pretested in Germany and Spain and has meanwhile entered a more ambitious pilot phase in 2018. One of this paper's aims is to get feedback from scholars studying EES regarding our proposed method. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Although entrepreneurship is considered one of the most powerful drivers of national economies around the world, there is little consensus about what informal factors foster entrepreneurial intention. In accordance with recent literature, entrepreneurial self-identity perception, the perception of corruption in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, and perceived exogenous and endogenous obstacles to entrepreneurship were hypothesized as antecedents of college students' and graduates' entrepreneurial intention. A study with a sample (N = 153) composed of college students and graduates from an Italian university was conducted. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to test the research hypotheses. The hypotheses that entrepreneurial self-identity perception and corruption perception of the entrepreneurial ecosystem are positive antecedents of entrepreneurial intention were confirmed. Corruption was considered as a viable and socially acceptable strategy that entrepreneurs might adopt in order to easily overcome governmental norms and rules about managing firms. It was hypothesized that the perception of corruption of the entrepreneurial ecosystem might be a positive antecedent of entrepreneurial intention if the subjects perceived the corruption as pervasive of the economic ecosystem and the effort made by national government to control corruption as ineffective. From this point of view, the positive causal relationship between perceived corruption and entrepreneurial intention could reveal college students and graduates' propensity to perceive corruption as a phenomenon capable of generating a "grease the wheel" effect. © 2019 by the authors.

Social innovation is related to new products, services, and models aiming to improve human well-being and create social relationships and collaborations. The business model innovation (BMI) context can foster social innovation and can be applied in social innovation projects and initiatives. What is important for social BMI is the social mission, which needs to be defined in order to be able to move forward with the strategy, the value proposition, and the best practices of the business. Based on the existing social innovation literature and case studies, this paper proposes an &#x201C;ecosystem&#x201D; approach that can provide an integrated framework for social business models. This approach adopts the quadruple&#x002F;quintuple helix innovation models which are able to promote social innovation, enabling a locus-centric and triple-bottom-line-centric entrepreneurial process of knowledge discovery and exploitation. Such a framework may help to study the role, nature, and dynamics of social co-opetitive fractal ecosystems, given emphasis on civil society, political structures, environment, and sustainability. In addition, the social innovation case studies presented in this paper highlight that targeted open innovation is a key element for social BMI. IEEE

Understanding the circumstances and reasons which facilitate digital entrepreneurship (DE) is of interest to academic research, and guides business practice, as well as public policies aiming at supporting this phenomenon given its positive impacts in terms of job creation and economic growth. We define some relevant concepts and briefly map current research using a perspective that focuses on the way digital entrepreneurs create digital value by acquiring, processing, and distributing digital information. Through the adoption of a digital information processing perspective, we provide a micro-level approach to research on digital entrepreneurship (DE) that complements existing literature on DE focused at the systemic level (digital entrepreneurship ecosystems and in the digital platforms economy). We show how these two approaches can be jointly used to identify major research streams on DE: digital business models, the digital entrepreneurship process and the creation of digital start-ups, DE in digital platforms, and entrepreneurial digital ecosystems. As is the case with existing DE frameworks, our approach concurs in putting emphasis on the new collaborative and social dynamics enabled by digital tools to support knowledge sharing and facilitate opportunity recognition. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Although conventional register and survey data on entrepreneurship have enabled remarkable insights into the phenomenon, the added value has slowed down noticeably over the last decade. There is a need for fresh approaches utilising modern data sources such as Big Data. Until now, it has been quite unknown whether Big Data actually embodies valuable contributions for entrepreneurship research and where it can perform better or worse than conventional approaches. To contribute towards the exploration of Big Data in entrepreneurship research, we use a newly developed dataset based on publications of the German Press Agency (dpa) to explore the relationship between news coverage of entrepreneurship and regional entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, we apply sentiment analysis to investigate the impact on sentiment of entrepreneurial press releases. Our results show mixed outcomes regarding the relationship between reporting of entrepreneurial events, i.e. media coverage, and entrepreneurial activity in German planning regions. At this stage, our empirical results reject the idea of a strong relationship between actual entrepreneurial activities in regions and the intensity of it being reported. However, the results also imply much potential of Big Data approaches for further research with more sophisticated methodology approaches. Our paper provides an entry point into Big Data usage in entrepreneurship research and we suggest a number of relevant research opportunities based on our results. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Social entrepreneurship (the third sector) is an increasingly important global economic phenomenon that is squarely under the academic lens. Social entrepreneurship represents an interesting opportunity for policy makers to explore new frontiers of economic growth and implement innovation in a potentially growing services sector with possible job opportunities coming from new job creation in the upcoming decades. Based on evidence from Italy, this paper considers the broader picture of this phenomenon. Addressing the need to better understand the drivers of social entrepreneurship policy, we propose a model for interpreting the impact of the recent Italian reform of the third sector at various levels of the ecosystem, which favors innovation, technology adaptation, and greater employability. The presented results contribute to laying the foundation for the further development of a theory of entrepreneurship policy. © 2019 by the authors.

Planning and implementation of regional climate change adaptation requires new, integrated governance arrangements that often involve public and private actors. Although entrepreneurship is widely considered an important part of such arrangements, little is known about the conditions that enable it, and its actual role is under-researched. Through an in-depth case study of an ecosystem-based adaptation project in the Netherlands, we have analyzed how the variegated actors in a governance network shape six conditions for entrepreneurial success, established in the entrepreneurship literature. Through a framing analysis, we found that all six conditions, i.e., prior career experience, altruistic motivations, financial motives, social networks, financial capital availability, and policies and regulations, were the object of constant negotiations. Their salience varied during the project as a result of variegated framing practices. In the early stages, issue, identity, and relationship frames were used to create a network of people with a range of relevant experience, connected by altruistic motivations. However, as the project progressed, distrust frames and different spatial-and temporal-scale frames created tensions between public and private actors. Accordingly, process frames, financial motivations, and capital availability became increasingly salient, reflecting the need to consolidate rules, roles, and responsibilities. The findings suggest that approaches to climate change adaptation imply ongoing struggles over the conditions that enable entrepreneurial success. We thereby add an important new dimension to the study of adaptation governance. © 2019 by the author(s).

Ethnic entrepreneurship has emerged as an economic, societal, and political panacea to the growing number of refugees on the move across the globe. Employing the 2014 World Economic Forum framework, this article seeks to explore the Australian entrepreneurship ecosystem, to determine whether it is enabling migrants and/or refugees to become entrepreneurs with a focus on Syrian refugees. At its core, the Australian entrepreneurship ecosystem is comparatively strong in terms of human capital, accessible markets, and finance. Even within the three 'core' characteristics of the ecosystem, the Australian ecosystem falls short when examined through the lens of refugee entrepreneurs. Recommendations under the 2014 World Economic Forum framework are made that will assist key stakeholders in developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2018

The purpose of this study was to demystify the nexus between social capital and entrepreneurial success in South Africa. The study was quantitative and data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. A sample of 196 entrepreneurs was conveniently sought. Data was analysed using the structural equation model through the SmartPLS 3 software. The first hypothesis which stipulated that there is a significant positive relationship between Empowerment and Political Action (EPA) and Entrepreneurial Success (ES) was supported as posited by significant path findings (β=0.637; t=8.123; p < 0.0001). Secondly, hypothesis two findings (β=0.203; t=2.585; p=0.010) also alluded to a significant path between Social Cohesion and Inclusion (SCI) and Entrepreneurial Success (ES) among entrepreneurs in South Africa. Finally, the third hypothesis which stated there is a significant positive relationship between Groups and Networks (GN) and Entrepreneurial Success (ES) was not supported based on weaker path findings (β=0.083; t=1.071; p=0.285). © 2019 Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal.

This article focuses on the issue of transnational female entrepreneurs, who are currently the subject of interest by policymakers. For this purpose, an analysis of smart specialization policies used in the European Union is conducted as a way of understanding entrepreneurial behavior. In-depth interviews with female immigrant entrepreneurs in Portugal are conducted as a way of considering how diaspora networks in terms of people having the same cultural heritage can facilitate transnational entrepreneurship. Findings show that smart specialization policies can help female entrepreneurs manage their business ventures and undergo appropriate training programs. This helps with encouraging family engagement with business activities that makes use of transnational networks. In this way, increased numbers of female transnational entrepreneurs can be encouraged to create a more open and global entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2019, © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is threefold. It is aimed at identifying: a broad set of entrepreneurial activities; different university entrepreneurial models; and the entrepreneurial best practices of advanced European S&T universities. Design/methodology/approach: The paper has adopted a mixed-method design. By mainly relying on primary data, collected through questionnaires and interviews with those in charge of the technology transfer offices of 20 universities belonging to the CESAER association, the empirical analysis has combined both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Findings: The results of the empirical analysis have allowed five entrepreneurial activities to be identified. Three main entrepreneurial university models, based on different configurations of entrepreneurial activities, on different organisational and ecosystem characteristics and on a set of entrepreneurial best practices: an “engage” model, which focusses on local economic development; a “formal” model, which focusses on the financial advantage of universities and their faculties; and a “comprehensive” model, which focusses on the local economic development and the financial advantage of universities and their faculties. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation of the present paper concerns the limited number of sampled universities. Moreover, this paper is limited to the European area. Future research could enlarge this study by increasing the number of universities and by focusing on other geographical areas. Furthermore, the paper does not assess the effectiveness of the identified entrepreneurial models in supporting entrepreneurship and local economic development. Further research could extend the present analysis and fill these gaps. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the extant literature under many respects. First, it relies on original primary data. Moreover, it extends previous literature by encompassing the conventional distinction between formal and informal entrepreneurial activities. It also contributes to the emerging literature on entrepreneurial university models and the strategic approaches by identifying the different models of entrepreneurial universities in the European setting of S&T universities focusing on the role played by organisational and regional factors in affecting the adoption of a specific model by universities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This article assesses whether or not students with international exchange experience return to their home countries with qualitatively different perspectives on the way universities can play a role in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems. It includes survey data collected from 516 Brazilian undergraduates asked to rank characteristics of an entrepreneurial university on a scale from 1 to 5. The findings of this study suggest that those with international experience tended to emphasize connections between university and nonacademic partners, compared with nontraveling counterparts, who emphasized the importance of infrastructure in the university. Therefore, use of such programs may have an impact upon the structure of ST&I (Science Technology and Innovation) systems. © 2019 European Association for International Education.

Purpose: The modern knowledge-based economy acknowledges the role of the third mission of universities related to the process of knowledge transfer as a driving force to face sustainability issues, in addition to the two traditional missions focusing on research and teaching. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between internal environment, external environment, knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration and university performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test the conceptual model in the Chinese education system. Findings: The findings confirm the higher impact of internal environment on both knowledge exploitation and knowledge exploration as compared to external environment. Knowledge exploitation is more strongly related to university performance than knowledge exploration. These results highlight the imperative role of internal university stakeholders in fostering knowledge management strategies. In addition, they encourage academicians, practitioners and policy makers to focus their attention on the impact of knowledge management models, tools and practices in universities to achieve the entrepreneurial development which, in turn, has a positive impact on individual graduates and innovation ecosystems. Originality/value: The necessity to develop a more entrepreneurial university, as well as the lack of evidence of their development in emerging countries, highlights the need to investigate how specific factors and knowledge management processes are impacting the universities’ performance. In fact, although previous studies provide an explanation of the impact of internal and external factors on a university’s performance, contributions integrating these concepts with strategic knowledge management processes are still lacking. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The examination of entrepreneurial rates can provide information on the contribution of innovative activity to the local economy, given the functions of project selection and risk assessment. The goal of this paper is to evaluate entrepreneurial dynamics. Our hypothesis is that greater innovation activity offers more business opportunities, creating groups of entrepreneurs who will positively contribute to local economies. The GMM estimation was conducted by a dynamic panel with data from the 32 Mexican states from the 2005-2014 period. It was found that innovative activity, measured based on patenting and FDI, fosters the emergence of business-to-business (B2B) entrepreneurs. A significant innovation impact when grouping all entrepreneurs (consumers and industrial B2B markets) was not found. However, all entrepreneurs contributed positively as entrepreneurial capital to a greater per capita GDP. These results contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and developing economies. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.

This paper examines a transformative tourism case study driven by local entrepreneurship in the coastal and post-violence/peripheral village of Zumaia, in the Basque Country (Spain). This paper aims at addressing an innovative methodology called “Tourism Living Lab through Multistakeholders' Penta Helix framework” in response to a globalized trend of increasing visitors. The result shows democratic tourism policy-making practices at the local level, including: (i) a participatory strategic formulation process; (ii) by fostering a local entrepreneurial ecosystem to overcome “tourism-phobia”; (iii) while renewing local identity; and (iv) through bridging social capital for a new post-violence era in the Basque Country. © 2018 The Author(s).

An influential stream of research notes the importance of the culture and attractiveness of a place in creating a supportive environment where competition, creativity, and entrepreneurship can flourish. However, what specific kind of culture is attractive and actually needed remains both unknown and controversial. While several scholars have stressed the general importance of diversity and a vibrant cultural life, this paper attempts to introduce a new and complementary perspective that puts the role of subcultural scenes at the center of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Social and economic innovations have always been pushed forward by the pioneering subgroup of “creative destructors” that share values and beliefs that are different from the establishment. Thus, we believe that, instead of culture as a whole, it might be more promising to take a closer look at subcultures and their influence on urban creative and entrepreneurial scenes. We test this hypothesis by deploying exploratory factor analysis to compare the impact of different measures of subcultural amenities compared with the traditional measures used to reflect “mainstream” culture on start-up rates in the 69 largest cities in Germany. Our findings confirm the main hypothesis posited in this paper that the co-presence of subcultural amenities is positively associated with entrepreneurship. By contrast, mainstream culture has no significant impact on local start-up rates. These findings make an important contribution to the recent controversy within the regional study literature and provide insights and guidance for thought leaders in policy and urban planning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Policy makers need a thorough understanding of innovation dynamics within their local contexts to be able to devise the proper strategies for innovation capability building among entrepreneurs. While there is a nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem in Morocco, there is a lack of startup's innovation research. In this paper we intend to make both a conceptual and empirical contribution. From a theoretical background, innovation, as a concept, is very versatile. With a rich and fragmented corpus of innovation definitions classifications and types, it becomes important to develop a clear and a comprehensive overview of innovation typologies and their underlying dimensions. In this paper, we suggest, through a literature review, a multidimensional approach for the analysis of innovation typologies. Three clusters of dimensions have been identified for the classification of innovations: Innovation Intensity, Innovation Scope, and Innovation Depth. This framework addresses three families of questions: What is its degree of newness? What's the nature of the innovation? Where does it occur in the ecosystem? From an empirical perspective, this construct has been applied to a panel of 13 Moroccan entrepreneurs to discuss the types of innovations introduced by their startups. The strong interplay between disruptive and incremental innovation, the diversity of innovation scope with a dominance of product and business model innovation, the national emphasis with limited international impact are the main findings of this qualitative study. While there is lack of research on innovation at the enterprise level in Morocco compared with research about ecosystem, this work lays down some foundations for the study of innovation at the enterprise level and constitutes the first step for further research to understand Moroccan startup innovation capability. Ultimately this new stream of research in Moroccan startup innovation field will help entrepreneurs and policy makers in their innovation capability building efforts. © 2019 Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on how family firms execute open innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows (KF) to provide a deeper understanding of family firms’ ability to innovate through traditions and create value across generations. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical evidence was collected using an online survey of a sample of 208 Apulian entrepreneurs, who were members of the association of young entrepreneurs of Confindustria in the Apulia region (southern Italy). Findings: The study derives a model that explains the most relevant factors behind the innovation processes developed by young entrepreneurs in family firms: network membership benefits; KF; track record of innovation; and the entrepreneurial attitude of employees. Research limitations/implications: By integrating insights from different research streams, namely, innovation management, open innovation and family firms, the study provides a novel contribution to the open innovation process in family firms. Practical implications: The study offers interpretative lenses for entrepreneurs and managers to understand the most suitable knowledge transfer process for encouraging open innovation in family firms, taking into consideration young entrepreneurs’ traditions and interpersonal skills, the KF in local ecosystems and network benefits as the main variables supporting the innovation process. Originality/value: This study creates a link between open innovation and family firm research by providing an empirically grounded model illustrating how the innovation process is realized in family firms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Building on the observable trend toward increasing division of scientific labor in entrepreneurial ecosystems, we investigate the effects of different modes of implementation for external knowledge sourcing such as alliances and acquisitions. More specifically, by estimating a Poisson model based on 951 acquisitions by 209 companies from the biotechnology industry, the study analyzes two unique forms of external knowledge sourcing, namely alliances and acquisitions. In line with theoretical arguments, we find a saturating association of the exploration orientation of acquisitions with exploratory innovation output, while comprehensively controlling for prior exploratory and exploitative acquisitions and alliances, as well as other firm-level and acquisition-level determinants. We also find an inverted U-shaped association between the exploitation orientation of acquisitions and exploitative innovation output. These findings suggest that utilizing dissimilar knowledge sourced through acquisitions seems to have no inherent limitations; however, the inverted U-shaped relationship found for the exploitation orientation of acquisitions and exploitation innovation output indicates that utilizing similar knowledge has limitations and consequently an optimum level. We discuss the implications of this in the context of the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Research Summary: We conduct a field experiment at an entrepreneurship bootcamp to investigate whether interaction with proximate peers shapes a nascent startup team's performance. We find that teams whose members lack prior ties to others at the bootcamp experience peer effects that influence the quality of their product prototypes. A 1-SD increase in the performance of proximate teams is related to a two-thirds SD improvement for a focal team. In contrast, we find that teams whose members have many prior ties interact less frequently with proximate peers, and thus their performance is unaffected by nearby teams. Our findings highlight how prior social connections, which are often a source of knowledge and influence, can limit new interactions and thus the ability of organizations to leverage peer effects to improve the performance of their members. Managerial Summary: Researchers and policymakers believe that accelerators, incubators, and bootcamps help entrepreneurial ecosystems spur innovation and drive startup growth. The effectiveness of these organizations, in large part, depends on the new social interactions fostered among colocated entrepreneurs. Yet, little evidence exists about the extent to which such interactions actually lead to spillovers. We ran a controlled experiment at a startup bootcamp to investigate when entrepreneurs were most affected by their colocated peers. Not everyone benefited. We found that entrepreneurs with many prior ties to others at the bootcamp made fewer new connections, especially to neighboring peers, and thus did not experience significant spillovers. In contrast, those without prior connections experienced the greatest spillovers because they interacted frequently with people on nearby colocated teams. Our findings highlight how organizations like incubators and bootcamps, designed to foster new connections, might sometimes just reinforce old networks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Entrepreneurial activities cannot be rigorously controlled but measuring their efficiency is essential for improvements in decision-making. There are several ways to measure broad range of entrepreneurial activity on national and international level but to measure efficiency of smaller ecosystems such as academic startup mentor programs is still a challenge. We applied The new Kauffman Index that was generally designed for measure entrepreneurial activity on national level to measure startup activities in a university framework. We determined amending factors in order to the RNE, SD and sSA values could be interpreted in a smaller ecosystem too. The present study evaluates 48 academic startups that were registered for the period late 2017- early 2018 in Coworking StartUPS startup mentor project at Universidad Politécnica Salesiana, Ecuador. We were looking for the answer to how many of them have become viable companies in one year. 45,83% of the academic startups have ongoing revenue, being considered as viable startups in this study. The average revenue of the viable startups is 1127 USD per month that is 2,86 times greater than the minimum salary in Ecuador and is 1,87 times greater than the aver-age salary of the capital. Our results seem promising considering that in our study only the via-ble startups were interpreted as companies for determining RNE and SD, and the total number of graduate students was interpreted as population. Universities are expected to prepare their stu-dents for the life after-graduation. Considering the high amount of viable startups having differ-ent business areas that are being mentored in the Coworking StartUPS project, it can be con-cluded that the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana makes great efforts to promote and teach en-trepreneurship to its students regardless of the field of expertise. © 2019 Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal.

Economic freedom facilitates the market selection mechanism that enables the Schumpeterian creative destruction process. I develop a framework depicting how economic freedom, which reduces entry barriers and transaction costs, acts as an external enabler that facilitates the creation of firms and jobs. It also facilitates the market correction device, potentially serving as a disabling force to allow firm and job destruction. Using a novel metropolitan statistical area–level dataset, I investigate empirically the role of local economic freedom on dynamism for a sample of nearly 300 U.S. cities over the period 1972–2012. My results confirm that economic freedom is positively associated with firm and job creation, but it has no effect on firm and job destruction. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: By drawing upon the resource-based view theory, this study investigates the critical resource determinants of start-up companies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in order to encourage the development of entrepreneurship in the region. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on multiple linear hierarchical regression analysis was used. Three sets of data were employed. Firstly, the study used the World Bank’s Doing Business Report which investigated the ease of starting businesses, access to electricity and access to credit across the 23 MENA countries. Secondly, the study also used the human capital index from the Global Entrepreneurship Index as one of the predictor variables of start-ups. Finally, three specific data sets, namely population, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Gross Domestic Product of the 23 MENA countries were used as control variables due to their importance as determinants of entrepreneurship orientation. Findings: The results of this study indicate that access to two critical resources, namely electricity and credit, have greatly contributed to the formation of start-ups in the MENA region. However, the current level of human capital in the region does not support entrepreneurial activity, hence its inability to support entrepreneurs in the venture creation process. There is a need to augment entrepreneurship education across the region, as well as the provision of entrepreneurial skill development to current and potential entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the study depended heavily on secondary data to examine the determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. Even though the sources of these data are credible, it is impossible to determine any anomalies in the original data. Secondly, the model used in this study is parsimonious in the sense that many more predictor variables could have been explored in understanding the determinants of start-ups in the region. Future research could therefore investigate other factors, such as technology, property rights, the legal system and other important factors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the MENA region. Originality/value: Start-ups are a major source of new employment in a country. However, it is essential to understand the various factors which foster their survival and growth. Even though similar studies have been conducted in various settings, this is one of the few studies which have focused on empirical investigation into the resource determinants of start-ups in the MENA region. The MENA region is noted for its access to abundant oil reserves and other resources. However, this has not culminated in the emergence of successful start-ups. This is what has necessitated this study; to investigate the factors that are responsible for start-up growth in the region. The uniqueness of this study is that it is one of the few studies which have used a three-factor construct in investigating the drivers of start-ups in the MNEA region. This study adopts an exhaustive approach with different variables in different levels of analysis which can provide extra information for further comparative study. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper is about the young entrepreneur as an emerging social agent in contemporary Slovenia. Young entrepreneurs are affected by both an ideal sociality of entrepreneurial ecosystems and the small scale of their environment. This paper argues that while the former is promoted as a tool for strengthening local communities and a means of moving toward a prosperous future, the later prevents its actualization but provides security for young people. Family and other established social relationships are of considerable importance for maintaining young entrepreneurs' careers. © 2018 Croatian Ethnological Society. All rights reserved.

Purpose: Using various macro-level measures of economic and political performance Shleifer and Treisman (2005) and Treisman (2014) call Russia a “normal country” implying that Russia’s economic and political development is not deviating from the other middle-income or transition countries significantly. The purpose of this paper is to challenge this proposition and investigate whether Russia is a normal country in terms of entrepreneurship by comparing Russia with other post-socialist and similarly developed countries. Design/methodology/approach: Many studies have examined Russia’s institutional setup to explain its deficiencies in entrepreneurial activity. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research taking into account both the individual and institutional dimensions of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The authors use the Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) methodology to analyze Russia’s quality-related individual as well as institutional features from a system perspective in a single model. Findings: Russia’s performance has been poor relative to the post-socialist countries and to most of the former republics of the Soviet Union. Russia’s entrepreneurial profile is different from other transition and similarly developed non-transition countries, as well. Russia’s scores are less than the scores of other post-socialist countries in six out of the nine pillars of entrepreneurial attitudes and abilities. In sum, conditions supporting entrepreneurship in Russia lag seriously behind other post-socialist countries. Moreover, Russia’s individual scores are even lower than the institutional ones. Hence, improving the hostile environment alone would not be sufficient for entrepreneurship development. Originality/value: Although, there have been numerous studies analyzing Russia’s macroeconomic conditions, institutional development, and entrepreneurship, there is lack of comprehensive studies. Besides common macro-level measures, the authors use a unique, GEI data set that combines institutional factors relating to entrepreneurship or new business creation with measures of individual capabilities, motivations, and attitudes about entrepreneurship. The single-model framework reveals that individual factors are even greater obstacles to entrepreneurship development in Russia than the institutional factors that most studies focus on. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Entrepreneurial ecosystems – the inter-related forces that promote and sustain regional entrepreneurship – are receiving intense academic, policymaker and practitioner attention. Prior research primarily focuses on mature entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in large, urban areas. Scholars are slow to examine the functioning of EEs in small towns, which face unique challenges in spurring entrepreneurial activity. Most notably, small town EEs are dependent on a key stakeholder group – local customers – which receives almost no attention in prior research on ecosystems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for understanding the role of customers in EEs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper integrates work on the service-dominant logic and service ecosystems with entrepreneurship research to theorize about the influence of customers in small town EEs. Findings: The proposed theory draws attention to the role of customers in evaluating the services provided by entrepreneurs and co-creating value in small town EEs. Theory is developed about the influence of three sets of customer characteristics on entrepreneurial activities: the local market potential (based on the number of local and transient customers), customers’ abilities to access the ecosystem (based on income levels) and customers’ preferences for services provided by the ecosystem’s entrepreneurs (based on preferences for innovativeness, local versus global brands and in- versus out-shopping). Originality/value: Entrepreneurial ecosystems research has implicitly adopted a producer-dominant logic focusing on entrepreneurs and their ventures as the primary creators of value. The proposed theoretical framework applies the service-dominant logic to EEs and conceptualizes EEs as a unique type of service ecosystem. The theorizing generates implications for scholars and practitioners and suggests that more work is needed at the interface of entrepreneurship, marketing and regional economic development. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to discuss the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Guyana with particular emphasis on the role of cultural support and its possible impact on the tourism industry in the country by 2025. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review of entrepreneurship ecosystems, document analysis of key reports on Guyana and interviews with relevant authorities. Findings: The paper observes that Guyana can focus entrepreneurial efforts on areas of natural comparative advantage, including nature-based tourism and agriculture. However, achieving high-impact entrepreneurship in developing world economies like Guyana requires a strategic approach that is process oriented and which addresses cultural impediments to entrepreneurship. Practical implications: Encouraging wealth creation and addressing issues of poverty and inequality are but a few of the concerns governments grapple with. Guyana is no different to its geo-political counterparts who are pushing entrepreneurship as a viable means of addressing these concerns. Driven by factors such as setbacks experienced by those with a socialist agenda, the onset of globalisation, the removal of preferential agreements, the opening of trade routes and an emphasis on local economic development, much has been made of entrepreneurship as a panacea of development issues. Originality/value: This paper seeks to contribute to a better understanding of entrepreneurship in a developing world context with particular significance for the tourism industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Innovation and entrepreneurship education has become an educational form and concept in the era of knowledge economy and it is an inevitable trend in college education to extensively promote innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities. Also, it is an inevitable demand for the talent cultivation of higher education to constantly promote and upgrade the quality of innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities. This paper discusses the development of innovation and entrepreneurship education in China's colleges and universities through questionnaires and it is found that the current situation for innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities is low awareness, relatively weak consciousness and the incomplete curriculum system. At the same time, based on the entrepreneurial ecosystem theory, a new innovative and entrepreneurial education model is established, which embeds innovation and entrepreneurship education into the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The practice proves that this model has a good effect on the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, which is of great theoretical and practical significance for the continuous improvement of education mode. © 2018 EDAM.

Festivals play an important role in rural communities, and they are typically embedded in the local ecosystems of sports, culture, business and other types of associations, where they might deliver elements of coherence, commitment and meaning, as well as occasional economic benefits. This study aims to showcase the business entrepreneurship aspect of festivals in Danish rural areas, and it is based on primary data from 315 festivals. Special emphasis is placed on the nature, prevalence and importance of business activities at such festivals and on the opportunities for entrepreneurs to utilize festivals as a means of business development in relation to sales, marketing, product testing, and customer feedback. On the one hand, the results show that very few of the surveyed festivals are entirely commercial and that commercial objectives are, due to ideological and relational reasons, generally low-ranked by organizers. On the other hand, there is strong evidence that local businesses actually participate in rural festivals' ecosystems and that there are numerous mutual interactions among local businesses, festival organizers and residents that together create an excellent means for driving entrepreneurial activity. It is a delicate undertaking to strengthen partnerships with entrepreneurs without compromising community objectives. Several potential courses of action are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

How the growing world population can feed itself is a crucial, multi-dimensional problem that goes beyond sustainable development. Crop production will be affected by many changes in its climatic, agronomic, economic, and societal contexts. Therefore, breeders are challenged to produce cultivars that strengthen both ecological and societal resilience by striving for six international sustainability targets: food security, safety and quality; food and seed sovereignty; social justice; agrobiodiversity; ecosystem services; and climate robustness. Against this background, we review the state of the art in plant breeding by distinguishing four paradigmatic orientations that currently co-exist: community-based breeding, ecosystem-based breeding, trait-based breeding, and corporate-based breeding, analyzing differences among these orientations. Our main findings are: (1) all four orientations have significant value but none alone will achieve all six sustainability targets; (2) therefore, an overarching approach is needed: “systems-based breeding,” an orientation with the potential to synergize the strengths of the ways of thinking in the current paradigmatic orientations; (3) achieving that requires specific knowledge development and integration, a multitude of suitable breeding strategies and tools, and entrepreneurship, but also a change in attitude based on corporate responsibility, circular economy and true-cost accounting, and fair and green policies. We conclude that systems-based breeding can create strong interactions between all system components. While seeds are part of the common good and the basis of agrobiodiversity, a diversity in breeding approaches, based on different entrepreneurial approaches, can also be considered part of the required agrobiodiversity. To enable systems-based breeding to play a major role in creating sustainable agriculture, a shared sense of urgency is needed to realize the required changes in breeding approaches, institutions, regulations and protocols. Based on this concept of systems-based breeding, there are opportunities for breeders to play an active role in the development of an ecologically and societally resilient, sustainable agriculture. © 2018, The Author(s).

Purpose: The literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems is fragmented, and yet, no studies have paid attention to integrating the available studies. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of contributions related to entrepreneurial ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: This literature review evaluates studies that are covered in the Web of Science index. Findings: In addition to the recent state of research (covering industries, geographical scopes, methodologies, etc.), this study provides an extension of Isenberg’s (2011) model of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: A new avenue arises for both conceptual and empirical research by emphasizing crowdsourcing as a contributing element for the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Future studies can evaluate the effectiveness of different types of crowdsourcing profoundly to make sure whether creating a promising ecosystem all types of crowdsourcing have a similar value or impact. Practical implications: For public policy and local decision-makers, both collaboration opportunities and interaction interfaces between the stakeholders of the entrepreneurial need to be reconsidered in the design of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Social implications: Higher degrees of collaboration, information exchange and innovation are likely to yield favorable entrepreneurship environments. Originality/value: Novelty of this study arises from integrating crowdsourcing theory in the systematic review of entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Summary: Companies sponsor platform ecosystems as an open innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem. In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of information—a subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial Summary: The digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability. © 2018 Strategic Management Society

This paper has attempted to set out the key issues related to entrepreneurship in the context of its relationship with the role of cultural support with the qualification of the entrepreneurs The study is then widened to comprehend the determinants of entrepreneurship and its location for its improvement. Subsequently the arrangements that are important to make this situation conducive have been examined in detail. The non-specific imperatives that are looked by entrepreneurs have been conferred down. The paper additionally stresses the significance of entrepreneurship in Odisha. The conclusion reflects that for economic development entrepreneurship is very important. . Entrepreneurial introduction depends on the cultural support and consequent development of indigenous organizations. This thusly would make employments and increase the value of a locale, and in the meantime it will keep scarce resources within the community. © 2018 IAEME Publication. All rights reserved.

Social entrepreneurship is a complex phenomenon with various meanings and approaches, its main features being to create social value through social innovation, to satisfy diverse social needs at systemic level, from poverty to unemployment, from social exclusion to population aging, and so on. Social entrepreneurship activities are influenced by environmental factors that are part of the so-called entrepreneurial ecosystems, and consist of components whose interdependence and interaction have a major impact on this sector. The purpose of this exploratory research (the sources used are secondary, which leads to a desk research) is to analyze the challenges faced by social entrepreneurship in Romania from an evolutionary perspective. The analysis focuses on the legislative framework and some of the components of the ecosystem of social entrepreneurship. © 2018 Faculty of European Studies.

Research Summary: In recent decades, two emergent phenomena have jointly transformed the nature and pursuit of entrepreneurship across industries and sectors: open innovation and platformization. Open innovation involves a shift toward more open and distributed models of innovation, while platformization refers to the increasing importance of digital platforms as a venue for value creation and capture. Together, open innovation and platforms have created numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and their firms—from serving as inputs for innovation for established firms to participating as complementors on existing platforms. While these entrepreneurial opportunities (and conditions) have manifested themselves in rich and varied ways, our understanding of these new forms of entrepreneurship has lagged behind. In this essay, and in this special issue, our objective is to bring a sharper focus on the important research issues and questions that frame open innovation, platforms, and entrepreneurship. Managerial Summary: Digital platforms and open innovation environments have unleashed numerous promising opportunities for entrepreneurs, in industries ranging from consumer software, entertainment, and home appliances to auto, health, and energy. To pursue those opportunities, however, entrepreneurs will need to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that facilitate and constrain them. In this essay, we identify and discuss several of these factors and the associated challenges and highlight the need for additional research. We also consider some of the broader contextual factors, including regulatory policies, digitization, and globalization that shape the emerging opportunities. © 2018 Strategic Management Society

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe a dynamic and continuous process for evaluating entrepreneurship pedagogies to implement continuous improvement of entrepreneurship education in order to achieve increased student engagement in face-to-face classes. Pedagogy is argued to be a significant contributor to entrepreneurship education programmes, consisting of dynamic activities and initiatives within the scope of defined entrepreneurship education ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: A “minute paper” was used as a quick and convenient method to obtain qualitative data on student perceptions of different pedagogies. The research adopted an action-research strategy where data were analysed using concept mapping to identify key themes that the educator can use to further develop or modify the pedagogy during course delivery. Findings: The research identified student perceptions of the nature of engagement with pedagogies, and of possible improvements that were used by the educator to increase student engagement during course delivery. Different pedagogies were found to have varying outcomes on students’ engagement with entrepreneurship learning, and as such, contextual and spatial factors have to be taken into account when implementing new and/or adjusted pedagogies. Research limitations/implications: Repeated application of the research method to different pedagogies was carried out in several deliveries of an undergraduate entrepreneurship foundation course in one university. As such, further research requires testing in various institutional and delivery contexts as well as comparisons of learning and other outcomes including entrepreneurial intentions between classes where particular pedagogies may or may not be used. Practical implications: The approach described is relatively straightforward to implement, with marginal resource and time. It provides rich data that gives insights into student perceptions of engagement with an individual pedagogy that the educator can use to modify to modify in order to increase student engagement. Originality/value: The paper describes a practical method for educators to evaluate and develop optimal pedagogies for a particular class or group of students. This method can be applied to small as well as large class sizes, and data analysis can be carried out in real time to make improvements during course delivery. Although this method is described in the context of entrepreneurship education, it can be applied to other fields of instruction. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: By drawing upon institutional theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of four critical resources (credit, electricity, contract enforcement and political governance) in explaining the quality of entrepreneurship and the depth of the supporting entrepreneurship ecosystem in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach based on ordinary least squares regression analysis was used. Three data sources were employed. First, the Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) of 35 African countries was used to measure the quality of entrepreneurship and the depth of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Africa which represents the dependent variable. Second, the World Bank’s data on access to credit, electricity and contract enforcement in Africa were also employed as explanatory variables. Third, the Ibrahim Index of African Governance was used as an explanatory variable. Finally, country-specific data on four control variables (GDP, foreign direct investment, population and education) were gathered and analysed. Findings: To support entrepreneurship development, Africa needs broad financial inclusion and state institutions that are more effective at enforcing contracts. Access to credit was non-significant and therefore did not contribute to the dependent variable (entrepreneurship quality and depth of entrepreneurial support in Africa). Access to electricity and political governance were statistically significant and correlated positively with the dependent variables. Finally, contract enforcement was partially significant and contributed to the dependent variable. Research limitations/implications: A lack of GEI data for all 54 African countries limited this study to only 35 African countries: 31 in sub-Saharan Africa and 4 in North Africa. Therefore, the generalisability of this study’s findings to the whole of Africa might be limited. Second, this study depended on indexes for this study. Therefore, any inconsistencies in the index aggregation if any could not be authenticated. This study has practical implications for the development of entrepreneurship in Africa. Public and private institutions for credit delivery, contract enforcement and the provision of utility services such as electricity are crucial for entrepreneurship development. Originality/value: The institutional void is a challenge for Africa. This study highlights the weak, corrupt nature of African institutions that supposedly support MSME growth. Effective entrepreneurship development in Africa depends on the presence of a supportive institutional infrastructure. This study engages institutional theory to explain the role of institutional factors such as state institutions, financial institutions, utility providers and markets in entrepreneurship development in Africa. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Policy-related discussions increasingly view universities as so-called “engines of economic growth”. Recognizing that the economic impact of universities is dependent, at least in part, on the success of university-affiliated entrepreneurial ventures, this paper reviews the extant literature to understand how academic entrepreneurship is conceptualized and the extent to which it adopts an ecosystem approach. We find that scholars have largely focused on individual ecosystem elements and characteristics, eschewing strategic and systemic conceptualizations of entrepreneurship ecosystems. As a result, we argue that the ecosystem perspective has not been fully leveraged to influence policy decisions. We conclude by offering several concrete recommendations on future research directions that, if pursued, would further enhance our understanding of the economic impact of universities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We analyze conceptually and in an empirical counterpart the relationship between economic growth, factor inputs, institutions, and entrepreneurship. In particular, we investigate whether entrepreneurship and institutions, in combination in an ecosystem, can be viewed as a “missing link” in an aggregate production function analysis of cross-country differences in economic growth. To do this, we build on the concept of National Systems of Entrepreneurship (NSE) as resource allocation systems that combine institutions and human agency into an interdependent system of complementarities. We explore the empirical relevance of these ideas using data from a representative global survey and institutional sources for 46 countries over the period 2002–2011. We find support for the role of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in economic growth. © 2018, The Author(s).

In this paper, we introduce the special issue on Financial and Institutional Reforms for an Entrepreneurial Society in Europe. There are many reasons for Europe to want to make the transition to a more Entrepreneurial Society. And for decades now, policy makers are trying to bring that transition about with variations on the “educate, deregulate and finance” approach to entrepreneurship. We argue that more fundamental reforms are required to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem and bring about this transition. We then discuss the 12 contributions that pertain to five different facets of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The first two papers address the most fundamental institutional foundations of the ecosystem. The next three papers discuss the (lack of) access to knowledge and incentives to start innovative entrepreneurial ventures. That is followed by three papers that focus on the institutions that (fail to) channel financial resources to such ventures and two papers that analyze the relevance of labor market institutions. The special issue concludes with two papers investigating how the interplay of institutions and productive entrepreneurship results in economic growth. © 2018, The Author(s).

While entrepreneurship researchers agree that institutions ‘matter’ for entrepreneurship, they also have a rather encompassing understanding of institutions as almost any external factor that influences entrepreneurship. Ultimately, this literature thus comes up with a long list of institutional factors that may explain entrepreneurial differences between countries. But which institutions are most influential? How do these institutions relate to different types of entrepreneurship? And to what extent are institutions complementary to each other in the way they sustain different entrepreneurship types? The literature on ‘Varieties-of-Capitalism’ (VoC) offers a parsimonious theoretical framework to address these questions. Based on the VoC literature, we theoretically derive a consistent set of institutional indicators that can explain differences in entrepreneurship types between countries. Based on principal component and cluster analyses, we illustrate how 21 Western developed economies cluster around four distinct institutional settings. Furthermore, we use simple OLS regressions to show how these institutional constellations are related to different types of entrepreneurship. We conclude that four different ‘Varieties of Entrepreneurship’ can be identified across the Western world. The main implication of our findings is that a ‘perfect’ institutional constellation, equally facilitating different types of entrepreneurship, does not exist. Policy-makers seeking to stimulate entrepreneurship are thus faced with the trade-off of targeting policy reforms to that entrepreneurship type they intend to promote—at the expense of other types of entrepreneurship and the broader societal consequences such reforms will have. © 2018, The Author(s).

Despite the emergence of startup accelerators as venture development organizations (VDOs) to high-growth firms, research has yet to identify where these accelerators fit into the venture development ecosystem. By clarifying and reviewing three different subsystems in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, our paper proposes that as an extension of the current incubation mechanism, accelerators contribute to the entrepreneurial ecosystem by transforming entrepreneurs and their ventures at early stages. Drawing upon the Pipeline model (Lichtenstein, G. A., and T. S. Lyons. 2006. "Managing the community's pipeline of entrepreneurs and enterprises: A new way of thinking about business assets." Economic Development Quarterly 20 (4): 377-386.), we first plot where the accelerator model fits in the broader entrepreneurship ecosystem, and then demonstrate how different types of accelerators help participating entrepreneurs and their ventures progress along the venture development pipeline. Our theoretical approach contributes to both the entrepreneurship ecosystem and the accelerator literature and provides a practical map for both policymakers and early-stage entrepreneurs to manage and utilize their entrepreneurship ecosystem more effectively. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise social media usage (SMU) as a contributory, knowledge management (KM) tool towards entrepreneurial behaviour amongst small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although an underdeveloped concept in entrepreneurship, the conceptual analysis of KM presents evidence which links SMU as complementary to changing KM conventions. Design/methodology/approach: The pertinent KM and SMU literatures of the SME context were reviewed to form an understanding of this context. Employing a mixed-methods approach, a pragmatic, thematic investigation of SMU-enhanced KM was facilitated. Findings: Substantial benefits of innovative SMU, as a management tool towards SME entrepreneurialism, were witnessed. SMU enhances the administration of real-time knowledge, encouraging creativity. However, longer-term costs of employing requisite personnel, and anticipated organisational restructuring, present challenges. The paper identifies the potentials of social media technologies in overcoming KM issues. The authors propose a reasoned process model towards entrepreneurial exploitation by acknowledging systematic phases of research, concept, institutionalise, develop, target and assess, referred to as the RCIDTA model. Practical implications: The authors argue that KM, through social media, facilitates interactions to execute innovative processes within SMEs ever-changing infrastructures. It also informs nascent entrepreneurs, in considering the benefits of systematic KM, and novel SMU, opportunities. The RCIDTA model for SMEs can be utilised in improving knowledge ecosystems of entrepreneurial SMEs, promoting innovation towards sustained organisation growth. Originality/value: This paper embraces the growing approach of SMEs applying SMU. SMU and its cost efficiency support the start-up activity. This paper highlights central issues concerning the exploitation of sector-specific KM, including organisational strategy, structure, brand formation, fiscal and personnel resource allocation and market share. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This article describes an American community survey and a survey of business owners of which the data are merged to assess the experiences of minority-versus white-owned small businesses between 2007 and 2012. This is highlighted due to it being a period encompassing the worst economic downturn since The Great Depression. White firms declined while minority firms grew rapidly. Despite recent efforts to create inclusive entrepreneurial and business ecosystems, however, minority business owners made little progress toward achieving equity or parity with white business owners. Policy prescriptions and implications for future research are discussed. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.

Unlike existing studies on entrepreneurial ecosystems that focus on the internal dynamics of such systems, this article argues that entrepreneurial ecosystems are linked to one another through economically specialised migrants that trigger their emergence and positively affect their future development. To illustrate the relation between migration and the dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems, a model is presented that distinguishes three different phases: (i) the remigration of highly skilled migrants, (ii) 'sunshine return migration' and (iii) the outmigration of local entrepreneurs to foreign entrepreneurial ecosystems. Even though the model is based on both existing literature and our own empirical findings in the Tel Aviv IT entrepreneurial ecosystem, it is argued that its implications also hold true for other regional contexts. © 2018 The Author(s).

The role of policy is often misunderstood, either revered as a panacea or despised as a barrier to change. This is especially true in the process of regional transformation. This article develops a case of economic development policy as an adaptive and improvisational process: effective policy is endogenous and the result of negotiations and power relationships. Transforming a regional economy involves myriad policy actions so subtle and so numerous that they can easily be overlooked. The article conceptualises effective policy as the continuous culmination of programmatic adjustments in response to changing conditions, and opportunistic pivots to adjust to new circumstances. Creating innovative, entrepreneurial ecosystems challenge our existing economic models and suggest that complexity requires new conceptualisations of policy and planning. © 2018 The Author(s).

The paper proposes a framework for measuring and testing the causal effects of a set of entrepreneurial ecosystems factors (eco-factors) on productive entrepreneurship (eco-output). Existing research studies provide long lists of relevant eco-factors; however, the causal relations of eco-factors with productive entrepreneurship has not been sufficiently and holistically studied. As the research on entrepreneurial ecosystems continues to develop, there is a need for a measurement framework and subsequent empirical validation of these causal relations. Otherwise, research on entrepreneurial ecosystem risks engaging only in a simple description of successful territories without the possibility of generalizing findings. Therefore, our paper’s contribution is a critical review of the set of eco-factors proposed by the extant literature and propose indicators and related data sources that could be used to measure the indicators more holistically. In an analogous way, with respect to eco-output, our contribution is to trace which indicators are the appropriate proxies for productive entrepreneurship and to explore the data sources for these indicators. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The entrepreneurial ecosystem, an emerging and developing theoretical stream, has the potential to expand our understanding of entrepreneurship. In previous research, this concept has been studied from the university perspective, but it has not yet been introduced in the field of entrepreneurial support. Additionally, the growing number of university business incubators has led to increasing research interest in the entrepreneurial support field. This research project seeks to develop a more robust understanding of sustainable university-based entrepreneurial ecosystems through an in-depth analysis of an essential entrepreneurial support element: the university business incubator. Our exploratory research study draws on 48 face-to-face interviews with key members of university-based entrepreneurial ecosystems to explore the operation of three cases through the lens of social capital theory. Our analysis suggests that all three social capital dimensions are relevant to the effective functioning of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem and contribute to its sustainability: applying the structural dimension of social capital enhances access to resources; addressing the cognitive dimension strengthens relationships among ecosystem members; and investing in the relational dimension enhances complementarity and trust while the ecosystem evolves. Thus, the interaction of these dimensions may further contribute to the sustainability of the university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem. Enhancing the development and application of the three social capital dimensions as an aspect of proactive management of the entrepreneurship ecosystem has the potential to improve outcomes for ecosystem members. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This round table article takes stock of the Indian startup ecosystem against the backdrop of its meteoric rise in recent years. The discussion identifies several positive aspects of the ecosystem—a plethora of opportunities to explore, availability of ample venture funding, and a young, educated workforce. However, in order to live up to its promise, the ecosystem needs to focus on value creation as opposed to valuation, educate its young entrepreneurs, and develop tolerance for well-intentioned failure. It also needs to solve the unique problems of India and ensure that the startup movement is inclusive. © 2018

Innovation hub organizations have become a fixture in African cities. Proponents of hubs commonly envision them to function as network infrastructures. Specifically, hubs are conceived of as network intermediaries within entrepreneurial ecosystems, allowing for seamless collaboration between diverse actors. This paper grounds such visions and conceptualizations, presenting case studies of two hubs in Rwanda: kLab and The Office. It draws on interviews with 47 participants with a stake in technology entrepreneurship in Kigali, about half of them founders or CEOs of small technology startups. Ultimately, the case studies show that implementation realities of hubs are far removed from aspirational visions. Notably, the paper finds that facets of community (such as boundaries and cultures) need to be continually negotiated between hub leaders and entrepreneurs, resulting in tensions and tradeoffs. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Environmental factors determine several features of society, but are becoming increasingly relevant in the entrepreneurship process. In recent years, entrepreneurship has been expanding worldwide and implies an exponential role of the environment. Accordingly, research into this phenomenon has also increased: contributions have rocketed, including increasingly complex and sophisticated analytical frameworks and empirical studies. This research aims to offer, through a bibliometric analysis, a comprehensive picture of research into entrepreneurial ecosystems using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database published in Web of Science journals during the period 2004-2016. A bibliometric analysis allows us to identify both the leading authors and journals that contribute to the progress made by the literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems. We expect our analysis to be useful to both junior and experienced scholars. The results show that the entrepreneurial ecosystems literature has a relatively high impact, as well as a high demand of related journals (an indicator about the quality of studies). © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

The geographical nature of knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurship has been well documented in the literature. In most regional or urban studies, these two topics are separately discussed. This research reviews literature at the intersection of knowledge spillovers, entrepreneurship, and regional economic development. The key argument is that entrepreneurship can serve as a mechanism for transmitting knowledge spillovers and accordingly contribute to regional innovation, cluster formation, and economic development. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on various factors in the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, notably including knowledge bases, absorptive capacity, competition, networks of people, diversity, and culture. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems are receiving heightened attention from scholars and practitioners. Studies have focused on isolating entrepreneurial ecosystems' components; however, prior research has not offered a theory of entrepreneurial ecosystems that embraces their complexity. To address this omission in ecosystems research, we contend that entrepreneurial ecosystems can be more fully understood if examined through the lens of complexity science and conceptualized as complex adaptive systems. We contribute to entrepreneurship research by developing a complexity-based definition of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Building on this definition, we connect the research on entrepreneur- and venture-level complexity to work on entrepreneurial ecosystems and propose three related forces that will influence entrepreneurial ecosystem emergence: intentionality of entrepreneurs, coherence of entrepreneurial activities, and injections of resources. Beyond developing theory, we describe how scholars can examine entrepreneurial ecosystems as complex systems using qualitative comparative analysis, agent-based modeling, and interpretivist methods. Our theorizing also has implications for entrepreneurs and policymakers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The existence of an effective entrepreneurial ecosystem is important for economic development and growth. This study considers how entrepreneurial ecosystems are perceived and operate in different locations focusing on remote islands compared to core/central regions. In particular, this study focuses on two remote island economies (the Canary Islands, in Spain, and Madeira, in Portugal), compared with Catalonia and Lisbon which are two core regions in Spain and Portugal. The evidence, based on a large-scale survey, shows that firms in remote islands perceive that they operate in a less favourable entrepreneurial ecosystem compared to firms in core regions although the findings show that there are significant variations across sectors of activity. Thus, the appropriate strategies for entrepreneurial action and for policy makers will vary depending on the characteristics of the ecosystem. © 2018 — Institute of Island Studies, University of Prince Edward Island, Canada.

In this editorial for the Special Issue on International Entrepreneurship, we inter-relate key concepts about the pursuit of opportunities from the entrepreneurship and international business literatures. In doing so, we consider the assessment of opportunities as an individual-level cognitive activity, the construction of opportunity as a firm-level innovative activity and the shaping of opportunity as an institutional-level structuring activity. We then extend the discussion to explore the notion of a distributed, global ecosystem of opportunities and opportunity seekers, which we believe may provide a platform for valuable future research. © 2018 Academy of International Business.

The Rising Tide Angel Training Program was launched to address the public policy priority of increasing the number of growth-oriented women-owned firms by expanding the entrepreneurial ecosystem in ways that will benefit women. In particular, the founders sought to address structural weaknesses in a key component of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, women’s access to financial capital in the form of equity, mentorship, and contacts. The Rising Tide Angel Training Program was launched in the fall of 2015 with the goal of increasing the number of women angel investors capable of investing in growth-oriented women-owned firms through a program of education, training, and hands-on experience with the angel investing process. In this paper, we present our findings from the first Rising Tide training cohort in terms of changes in participants’ motivations, attitudes, and expectations as they relate to angel investing. We also present findings on changes in knowledge, skills, and the ability to evaluate investment opportunities. Finally, we identify and discuss key “takeaways” from our first year’s experience with the Rising Tide Angel Training Program and next steps. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Although many governments actively stimulate self-employment, their work-related mental well-being remains understudied. The aim of current study is to investigate the mental well-being of different types of self-employed, testing whether mental well-being differences among self-employed are explained by the presence of work characteristics that are in accordance with the ideal-typical image of the “successful entrepreneur” (e.g. creativity, willingness to take risks, innovativeness, high intrinsic motivation, skilfulness and the ability of recognizing opportunities). Moreover, we investigate the relation of country-level “entrepreneurial climate” and the individual mental well-being of self-employed. For this purpose, data from the European Working Conditions Survey, round 6 (2015) was analysed, including 5448 cases, originating from the 28 EU-member states. Multilevel random intercepts modelling was used to investigate associations of both individual- and country-level characteristics with mental well-being. We found that motivation, the ability to recognize opportunities, and finding it easy to be self-employed positively influences the mental well-being of self-employed. Respondents with these characteristics are often medium-big employers, while farmers, dependent freelancers and own account workers generally have less of these features and tend to have lower levels of mental well-being. At the country-level, positive entrepreneurship perception relates to more advantageous mental health scores in self-employed. These results implicate that policies promoting self-employment should be (more) concerned with the work-related characteristics of (future) self-employed. © 2018 The Authors

An entrepreneurial ecosystem has emerged as a topic of research and debate amongst researchers and policymakers. Entrepreneurial ecosystems have captured the attention of nations in transforming their economies around the creation of innovative products and services, thereby leading to wealth creation and international competitiveness. The literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems is fragmented, and yet no studies have paid attention to integrating the available studies. This paper aims to provide a review of the literature on entrepreneurial ecosystem in order to create the following contributions. Firstly, this paper provides an insight on entrepreneurial ecosystem studies. Therefore, this study is a systematic effort to map out the research gaps and loopholes on the topic of Entrepreneurial Ecosystem. Secondly, by identifying the knowledge gaps in the contemporary literature, we propose a route for future research on the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This study supports policymakers and scholars in development of new policies conducive to regional systems of innovation and entrepreneurship. © IAEME Publication.

Research Summary: Entrepreneurial ecosystems have recently emerged as a popular concept within entrepreneurship policy and practitioner communities. Specifically, they are seen as a regional economic development strategy that is based around creating supportive environments that foster innovative start-ups. However, existing research on entrepreneurial ecosystems has been largely typological and atheoretical and has not yet explored how they influence the entrepreneurship process. This article critically examines the relationships between ecosystems and other existing literatures such as clusters and regional innovation systems. Drawing on this background, the article suggests that a process-based view of ecosystems provides a better framework to understand their role in supporting new venture creation. This framework is used to explain the evolution and transformation of entrepreneurial ecosystems and to create a typology of different ecosystem structures. Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurial ecosystems are a new buzzword within research and managerial circles. They represent the types of cultural, social, economic, and political environments within a region that support high-growth entrepreneurship. But current research does little more than look at successful ecosystems to identify best practices. This article examines what we know about entrepreneurial ecosystems and links them with existing theories like clusters and regional innovation systems. We argue that successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship within an ecosystem generates critical entrepreneurial resources like investment capital, skilled workers, and entrepreneurial knowledge. This, in turn, supports future high-growth venture creation. The types of resources available in an ecosystem and the ability of these resources to flow through social networks helps separate strong, well-functioning ecosystems from weak, poorly functioning ones.

This paper reviews the literature, concepts, and operationalizations of the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Despite some interest at the national level, entrepreneurship is understood to take place in localities or, at most, regions, drawing on local resources, institutions, and networks. Bibliometric evidence shows that usage of the term entrepreneurial ecosystem has overtaken other concepts, such as environments for entrepreneurship, which also highlight the mechanisms, institutions, networks, and cultures that support entrepreneurs. This review addresses several specific topics: the choice of scale, universities as ecosystem hubs, and how such ecosystems evolve. This is followed by suggestions toward an agenda for future research, placing particular attention on methodologies. © 2018 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Research Summary: This research uses insights from field theory to explore the early moments of how entrepreneurial ecosystems form through everyday interactions. We examine the cultural-cognitive and material micro-dynamics of activities occurring in support of social impact entrepreneurs and businesses from 2000 to 2014 in the Seattle, Washington, region using archival and interview data sources. The pattern of results about what actors do and how interactions change over time supports a two-period model of ecosystem formation where initial distributed and disparate activity undergoes a phase transition to coalesce into a more coordinated and integrated social order. The findings point to endogenous sources of structuring, including language and interaction, rather than exogenous sources such as government action or instrumental policy goals. Managerial Summary: How do the ecosystems that support entrepreneurs form? Rather than being created through top-down actions of governments and other powerful actors, we argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems form through the everyday interactions of individuals striving to create shared meaning, resources, and infrastructure needed to support their new ventures. This is especially true in ecosystems focused on creating social impact, which do not always offer the high returns expected in a market-based capitalistic system. Our study shows how the initial activities of distributed, disparate individuals and groups rather suddenly coalesce into more coordinated, integrated, and durable patterns of social interaction, creating the methods, resources, and legitimacy needed for an entrepreneurial ecosystem for social impact businesses to coexist with or change existing conventions of market-based capitalism.

Radically innovative products and services are frequently developed and commercialized by new ventures. In this context, entrepreneurs may face the challenge of coordinating a complex network of actors in the presence of individual and collective uncertainties. Previous literature on entrepreneurship has focused on how entrepreneurs manage individual uncertainties (those that affect a single firm) rather than collective uncertainties that also affect members of the innovation ecosystem, which in turn may fundamentally affect the survival and growth of new ventures. Drawing on five longitudinal, inductive, in-depth case studies of start-ups and their innovation ecosystems, we find that current approaches for coping with individual uncertainties do not consider the impacts of uncertainties and actions on the innovation ecosystem partners. In that sense, entrepreneurs themselves may contribute to the propagation of uncertainties in the innovation ecosystem. We also identify processes by which entrepreneurs manage collective uncertainties in the innovation ecosystem, i.e., perceiving collective uncertainties, bridging uncertainties, conducting collective learning experiments and building a common template. This study improves understanding of how entrepreneurs act in uncertain environments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This research explores how a research university develops its academic entrepreneurial ecosystem (AEE) through building up process mechanisms, thereby improving the academic entrepreneurship efficiency. We propose an individual-organisation-environment-process model, which we illustrate with the case study of Zhejiang University. Our findings pinpoint the importance of identifying the three basic mechanisms driving the AEE model, incentive, collaboration and capability mechanisms. The incentive mechanism is the driving force that could change the organisational framework, as well as individual research goals through the reform of the personnel assessment system and the entrepreneurial income distribution system. The collaboration mechanism is the vehicle of the AEE model that enables new entrepreneurial models and business start-up by improving university’s governance structures and building up entrepreneurial networks. The capability mechanism is the element for sustainable academic entrepreneurship through a combination of different entrepreneurial capabilities in a university. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.

The field of entrepreneurship is gaining acceptability among the youth of India. While the initiation, funding and success and failure of a start-up have been studied extensively, the entrepreneurial ecosystem that support, nurture and prepare entrepreneurs requires further examination. One such component of this ecosystem is the institutes of higher education that play a crucial role in preparing the future entrepreneurs of India. Though there seems to be a need for education programmes specifically designed to expand students’ skills in entrepreneurship, there is limited research on the entrepreneurial intention (EI) of students in India. In this article, we discuss the impact of implicit and explicit ways through which the entrepreneurship education in the institutes of higher education can influence EI among students in India. On the basis of the extant literature, the focus of this article is anchored in the four different aspects of EI among students: (a) Ability to have a grand vision (GVS); (b) Intentions to exploit opportunities (OEX); (c) Perseverance and operational focus (POF) and (d) Willingness to take risk (RST). In general, it is observed that the presence of EI is greater among students pursuing major in studies on entrepreneurship, whereas business students are mostly trained towards exploring the risk-taking component of EI. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.

Informal entrepreneurship is a persistent and extensive phenomenon in both developed and developing countries and considerable efforts have been made to understand it from an ecosystem perspective. Nevertheless, literature that analyzes networks within and among individuals in the informal economic sector has received less attention. This study presents an interesting extension of Granovetter's "strength of weak ties" hypothesis. Until now, strong ties are perceived to be constraining and less beneficial than weak ties for the entrepreneurial activity. However, this paper critically examines this assumption in the context of informal entrepreneurship to explore in detail this networking dynamic and how it affects their financial and social performance. A qualitative approach using 50 face-to-face interviews in Mexico was conducted. Our findings demonstrate that strong ties provide the resources, support and information informal entrepreneurs need to reduce their adversity and vulnerable conditions, having a positive impact on their financial and social outcomes. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Digital entrepreneurship is defined as the reconciliation of traditional entrepreneurship with the new way of creating and doing business in the digital era. This paper develops a framework for a specific type of Living Labs for promoting the digital entrepreneurship process, called PDEP-LL (Promoting Digital Entrepreneurship Process Living Lab) that begins with the idea generation and continues with different business management stages. In order to foster university-entrepreneur partnerships, the objective of the PDEP-LL is to provide services for several types of academic and industrial stakeholders in the digital business ecosystem for supporting entrepreneurs and start-up businesses. This Living Lab serves as a foundation for activities and their digital artefacts involved of each entrepreneurial stage, for different associated digital platforms and for professional support services. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

Stakeholder theory has thus far received limited attention in the context of entrepreneurship education and university management. This paper addresses this research gap by examining the collaboration of stakeholders from the entrepreneurial ecosystem in entrepreneurship education at European higher educational institutions (HEIs). We contribute to existing research by combining literature streams from the fields of entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial ecosystems and stakeholder theory. Empirical research is based on a cross-case analysis of 20 HEIs from 19 different European countries. Data sources include next to secondary data and observation a total 216 interviews with entrepreneurship education stakeholders at these 20 HEIs. The results of the case studies are further validated through an independent peer group and through 14 interviews with international experts in entrepreneurship education. Based on this data, an overview of the key external stakeholder groups of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of HEIs and their forms of involvement in entrepreneurship education is provided. Furthermore, the strength and coordination of stakeholder collaboration and the overall approaches to stakeholder management are discussed. This analysis results in the development of a set of propositions on stakeholder involvement in the context of entrepreneurship education at HEIs. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of stakeholder collaboration from the entrepreneurial ecosystem at HEIs. Implications of the findings for entrepreneurship educators and university management are ultimately discussed along with suggestions for further research. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Despite technological advances, smart home concepts are not receiving widespread adoption. Small businesses that install and maintain heating, security and energy-saving systems could play a major role in bringing advanced technologies to home owners. However, the role of such small installer businesses in the smart living industry is generally overlooked in practice as well as academic literature. This paper studies challenges small installer businesses face when offering smart home and smart living services. A survey, as well as in-depth interviews, are conducted. A main pattern across the findings is that small installers, despite their potential role, are reluctant to be involved in the smart living industry. Lack of knowledge and entrepreneurial skills, limited sharing of knowledge and lack of cooperation hinder small installer businesses to offer smart living services. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

When dealing with complex value-driven problems such as sustainable development, individuals need to have values and norms that go beyond the appropriation of tangible business outcomes for themselves. This raises the question of the role played by individual moral antecedents in the entrepreneurial process of opportunity recognition for sustainable development. To answer this question, an exploratory empirical research design was used in which 96 would-be entrepreneurs were subjected to real-life decision-making processes in an online environment. The participants were guided through the process of opportunity recognition for sustainable development. Furthermore, they were subjected to several tests linked to individual moral antecedents. The mixed methods design used to analyze the results led to the conclusion that pro-environmental behavior values and moral competencies are important indicators of the ability to recognize opportunities for sustainable development. These results provide useful insights about relating moral antecedents to idea generation for sustainable development and can help researchers, higher education institutes, and sustainable entrepreneurs to further develop the concept of sustainable entrepreneurship and its underlying processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This article seeks to advance our understanding of successful women entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa by examining how husbands contribute to women's entrepreneurial activity and performance. Little is known about husbands’ influence in this region, although sub-Saharan women entrepreneurs are deeply embedded in their families and are important drivers of social and economic development. Based on a systematic literature review identifying six recurring types of supportive and constraining spousal influence, we explore the implications for women entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that sub-Saharan Africa differs substantially from the context of previous research and derive propositions of how spousal influence is affected by resource-scarce entrepreneurial ecosystems, patriarchal societies and work-family integration. Our propositions illustrate the importance of contextualizing spousal influence and highlight that husbands are critical stakeholders for women entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2018, © 2018 Africa Academy of Management.

Past studies in the field of sustainable entrepreneurship have highlighted the need for future research to examine how a supportive external environment for sustainable entrepreneurship can be created. In order to address this research gap, this paper analyses the role of stakeholder support for developing sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. This paper is based on a systematic literature review of the fields of sustainable entrepreneurship, stakeholder management and entrepreneurial ecosystems. The findings highlight the importance of extensive, tailored and collaborative stakeholder support for encouraging engagement in sustainable entrepreneurship and for creating strong sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. This paper offers three main contributions. First, it opens a new conversation by merging three largely separate research fields to advance an understanding of the concept of a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem. Second, a framework of sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems is established. Third, it puts forward a set of propositions concerning the development of sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems. This paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for further research. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the entrepreneurship center (EC) in the larger entrepreneurial ecosystem. Entrepreneurial ecosystems thrive because of complex interdependencies and dynamic relationships between and among its participants. While the university has often been highlighted as a key player in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, the role of the EC within the university, despite its strategically influential position in stimulating entrepreneurship, has not received sufficient attention in scholarship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors attempt to address this gap in scholarship using an expert Delphi panel approach to explore the vital role that the EC plays in ensuring the vibrancy of the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. In doing so, the authors tackle the question of sustainability of the EC by outlining a structural framework and key job characteristics of the EC director so that it may thrive beyond the tenure of a transformational leader. Findings: In analyzing the responses of Delphi panelists and reviewing the theoretical foundations, the authors have identified three areas for discussion: the question of whether the EC director ought to be an academic job, the key skills of an effective EC director and how to sustain the EC after the departure of a transformative leader. Considering the vital role that the EC plays in the university and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems, these questions have importance for the future of the practice of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The role of the EC in the larger regional entrepreneurial ecosystem and the impact of the EC director are subjects that have been largely unaddressed by current scholarship. This is despite the growing number of ECs, the growth of entrepreneurship as a discipline, the desire to foster entrepreneurial universities and the struggle to find suitable EC leadership talent. The EC is critical for bringing together various actors within the regional entrepreneurship ecosystem, creating and maintaining an entrepreneurial culture and fostering co-curricular learning to develop human capital, key benefits that the university provides on top of its research activity. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to improve the current knowledge of the effects of a higher education program for entrepreneurs, integrated in an entrepreneurial ecosystem, in the entrepreneurial intention of the students. Design/methodology/approach - For this, group dynamics have been carried out with the students to know the process of entrepreneurial learning, the acquisition of competences, the mentoring received and the influence of the program in its entrepreneurial intention in the short and medium term. Findings - The results suggest that the program positively influences students' entrepreneurial intention, especially in the medium term. In particular, they point out that working personal skills in the program contribute to the development of their entrepreneurial project. On the other hand, mentoring requires a more methodical accompaniment and a greater degree of specialization of the mentors. Research limitations/implications - This research represents an excellent first step toward a better understanding of the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention. In addition, they lead to improve existing knowledge about the impact of entrepreneurial higher education. The only limitation of the paper is given by its nature as a case study. Practical implications - The case study aims to provide the results of the practical experience of a higher education program in entrepreneurship and serve as a basis for future lines of research that address the research gap based on the need of identification of best practices in entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial behavior. Social implications - This work brings practical experience that inspires diverse social actors as managers of higher education programs, managers of ecosystems entrepreneurs and public institutions. Originality/value - Our findings respond to previous concerns on the results of programs aimed at training future entrepreneurs. Besides, this work describes an interesting case study based on a postgraduate program, while most of the previous studies have been limited to undergraduate programs. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

In view of stimulating entrepreneurial drive for economic gains, it is pertinent to empirically unravel what entrepreneurial ecosystem variables significantly variate entrepreneurial orientation and intention. Within relevant theoretical postulations, this article aimed at determining the amount of variation in entrepreneurial orientation and intention as caused by entrepreneurial ecosystem factors over time. The key entrepreneurial ecosystem factors examined include: business protection; approval of reference people; state of infrastructure that supports intention; ease of accessing financial resources; friendly economic policies; and increase in technology. The study used a cross-sectional survey design following a quantitative approach. Using the simple random technique, data were collected from 191 university graduates via a 20-item questionnaire. Data were analysed using paired sample t-test and structural equation modelling. Findings show that there is significant variation in entrepreneurial orientation and intention which is directly or indirectly attributable to the uncontrolled interaction among entrepreneurial ecosystem variables such as approval of reference people; increase in technology; business protection, etc. This variation is however context-dependent. These findings suggest the need to create conducive entrepreneurial ecosystem to complement entrepreneurship education. It is therefore recommended that policy makers must be deliberate at creating complementary entrepreneurial ecosystem in the developing economy context, improve business protection for nascent entrepreneurs; ease the access to financial resources for entrepreneurial graduates; improve state of infrastructure needed for entrepreneurial drive, amongst others. In addition, academic planners should expand the focus of entrepreneurship education curriculum to include how to strategically deal with ecosystem factors that could significantly impact on entrepreneurial action. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

At present, the development of entrepreneurship is a priority task of social and economic development of Russia. The observed rates of socio-economic and innovative development of regions indicate that the private business initiative is not sufficiently developed. At the same time, the private business initiative is the leading driver of economic renewal of the territories. As practice shows, current measures, aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship, do not provide the growth of business activity and seem insufficient. These measures do not consider specific spatial context in which the business develops. Therefore, these reasons significantly reduce the effectiveness of these stimulating measures. In this regard, we estimate that the environment in which the elements of the system interact is gaining a great importance in the framework of a system approach to the study of the entrepreneurship development at the regional level. In practice, to manage the development of business structures in a spatial context, the ecosystem approach seems to be very promising. This approach takes into account the nature of the interactions of economic agents and their relationship with the environment. We highlight that the ecosystem approach to entrepreneurship is a transition from a traditional economic view of entrepreneurship, which is market-oriented to a new economic view that emphasizes people, networks and institutions. We substantiate that it is necessary to develop a methodological toolkit for monitoring the attractiveness of a regional entrepreneurial ecosystem for the generation and development of entrepreneurial processes. It is being an important element of the mechanism for designing and managing the development of business ecosystems. To determine the current state of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in a region, we have proposed a methodology for monitoring the state of the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. This method is based on a statistical analysis of the demographic quantitative and qualitative indicators characterizing the intensity of the development and extinction of entrepreneurial processes. As a result, we have expanded the concept of the ecosystem approach. Furthermore, we have justified its application for the investigation of entrepreneurial processes at the regional level. To study the current state of regional entrepreneurial ecosystems, we suggest to use a special statistical apparatus. This apparatus is based on demographic indicators characterizing the viability and growth potential of entrepreneurial structures in a specific spatial context. To further develop the ecosystem approach for the study of entrepreneurship at the regional level, there is an urgent need for further research that will allow to identify and understand the patterns of the development of entrepreneurial ecosystems. It will increase the effectiveness of practical measures for designing a mechanism for managing the development of regional entrepreneurship. © 2018 Institute of Economics Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In recent times, the propensity to establish a reciprocal association between universities and industries through an interchange of knowledge is becoming greater. In developing countries, the perception of academicians in entrepreneurial universities, however, is mixed. This research aims to satisfy a clear gap in the main field of research whereabouts only recent studies analysed the challenges imposed by knowledge management. The main objective looks into the factors contributing towards advancement of entrepreneurial university paradigms in a developing country, Malaysia. This study carried out a survey among academicians who are currently employed in 15 public and private universities. The majority of the respondents believe their university contains strong elements of entrepreneurism. With respect to previous literature, this study is useful for government and university authorities to formulate guidelines and policies to implement and reinforce the concept of entrepreneurial universities, in order to extend debates concerning the creation of entrepreneurship ecosystem. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The article deals with the development of entrepreneurship at the regional level. The necessity of taking into account the context and its impact on the practice of managing the development of entrepreneurship in the region is justified. For the study of entrepreneurship with the influence of the regional context considered, it is proposed to use the ecosystem approach, which allows focusing on the specific context of business development. Based on the analysis of foreign and domestic sources, the author's definition of the concept of "regional entrepreneurial ecosystem" is given. It is proved that, due to the uniqueness of each regional entrepreneurial ecosystem, it is advisable to use the configuration approach, which ensures that the diversity and variability of the regional context are taken into account. It is proposed to consider each regional entrepreneurial ecosystem as a set of nine configuration subsystems. The estimation of the configuration profiles implies using area or volume values, formed, in aggregate, by the parameters characterizing the configuration. A methodology for identifying the configuration profile of a given subsystem in a regional entrepreneurial ecosystem is developed. Based on the methodology in question, the efficiency of the configuration profiles of state institutions regulating entrepreneurship in the 85 subjects of the Russian Federation is identified. The approach substantiated in the article makes it possible to develop practical mechanisms for effective management of regional entrepreneurial ecosystem configurations, which, in turn, would contribute to more dynamic and predictable growth of business and investment activities in Russian regions. © 2018, Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.В статье рассматриваются вопросы развития предпринимательства на региональном уровне. Обосновывается необходимость учета контекстуальных влияний на практику управления развитием предпринимательства в регионе. Для исследования предпринимательства с учетом влияния регионального контекста предлагается использовать экосистемный подход, позволяющий фокусироваться на конкретном пространственно-временном контексте развития предпринимательства, в рамках которого учитывается характер взаимодействий экономических агентов и их взаимоотношений со средой функционирования. На основе анализа зарубежных и отечественных научных источников дается новое определение понятия «региональная экосистема предпринимательства». Доказывается, что вследствие уникальности каждой региональной экосистемы предпринимательства для ее исследования целесообразно использовать конфигурационный подход, который позволяет учитывать многообразие и изменчивость регионального контекста. В рамках этой методологии региональная экосистема предпринимательства рассматривается как совокупность девяти конфигурационных подсистем. Для оценки конфигурационных профилей используются площадные или объемные значения, в совокупности образованные показателями, которые характеризуют конфигурацию. Все анализируемые данные получают единое визуальное представление, что позволяет проводить сопоставление конфигураций различных региональных экосистем предпринимательства. Разработана методика идентификации конфигурационного профиля подсистемы региональной экосистемы предпринимательства. На основе предложенной методики проведена идентификация эффективности конфигурационных профилей институтов государственного регулирования предпринимательства в 85 субъектах РФ. Описанный в статье подход позволяет разрабатывать практические механизмы эффективного управления конфигурациями региональных экосистем бизнеса.

The entrepreneurship ecosystem concept has been examined by various scholars resulting in different definitions and the development of various frameworks. High-tech entrepreneurial ecosystems are special types that are closely linked to innovative, high growth firms. We argue that the logic of interpretation of high-tech entrepreneurial ecosystems is quite different from that of national entrepreneurial ecosystems. The latter are guided by national policies and follow mainly a top down approach. This paper posits that the emergence and development of high-tech entrepreneurial ecosystems follow mainly a bottom up approach. For this reason, we have used a complex adaptive systems framework to interpret high-tech entrepreneurial ecosystems. In addition, we have also examined the network effects in these ecosystems. Reflecting on these effects, we have highlighted the additional roles of agents such as universities and local governments in contributing to the success of high-tech ecosystems. Finally, we have developed propositions that could be transformed into testable hypothesis and suggested further research. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to examine the role of trust and distrust in social networks within the entrepreneurial ecosystem and to develop a conceptual scheme of the impact of trust and distrust on productive and unproductive entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a conceptual scheme, founded on the social capital and resource-based view of a firm, by exploring the impact of trust and distrust on entrepreneurial behavior in a social network. Findings: As the paper indicates, trust within an entrepreneurial ecosystem has a positive impact on productive entrepreneurship, while distrust within the ecosystem is expected to be unproductive and destructive (or potentially illegal) to an economy. Research limitations/implications: The research implication of this paper is that it connects levels of trust and distrust within the ecosystem to the type of the behavior exhibited by entrepreneurs leading either to productive or unproductive entrepreneurial endeavors. As this study is based on the theoretical review resulting in a conceptual scheme, it requires further investigation of proposed interactions. Practical implications: This paper offers strategic alternatives for entrepreneurs seeking to enhance future endeavors by strengthening trust within social networks for the mutual benefits of the ecosystem and businesses within it. Social implications: This study highlights the importance of two social constructs of trust and distrust in maintaining existing and developing future ecosystems. It also reviews potential outcomes of entrepreneurial behavior and their impact on economies. Originality/value: This research examines both trust and distrust (two separate social constructs) as significant predictors of future outcomes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem that go beyond productive entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Since the 1980s, entrepreneurship education in the United States has become increasingly popular. The system of entrepreneurship education in the United States is characterized by relatively scientific and systemic teaching and research. The concept of ecosystems, which comes from the natural sciences, is increasingly applied to regional development and focused on inter-organizational relationships. One way to assess the ecosystems of entrepreneurship education is to consider all components of the whole–the business model, teaching philosophy, curriculum, teaching content, teacher training, infrastructure, culture, network and practices of each country. A useful tool for understanding these interrelationships is the Triple Helix Model (university-government-industry). This approach is applied in here this research to compare and analyse the ecosystems of entrepreneurship education in the United States and China, the top two economic and entrepreneurial powers in the world. Government support and industry involvement have helped to make entrepreneurship education in the US successful. Compared with the US, entrepreneurship education has started late in China, where a pilot entrepreneurship program was launched at nine universities in April 2002. Teacher training in both entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial consultant team-building was based on the entrepreneurship education project known as Know About Business (KAB), a model created during the 1990s by the International Labour Organization (ILO) for developing countries and adopted by the All China Youth Federation in 2005. At present, China is launching a “Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation” campaign and investing heavily in universities and government youth agencies. Using the Triple Helix Model, the ecosystems of the Chinese and US entrepreneurship education will be compared and analysed. © 2018, Allied Business Academies. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore the contextual role of social-cultural capital in youth entrepreneurship between Malaysia and Lao PDR/Laos, comparing two different entrepreneurial ecosystems designed to identify emergent factors that stimulate and/or stifle the genesis of youth entrepreneurship while identifying similar and divergent entrepreneurial identities and traits among young people from these two sovereign contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing qualitative-based case study design approach, data collections were garnered from 30 informants through in-depth personal interviews, focus group studies coupled with personal observation conducted via purposive cum snowball sampling. Findings: Thematic analysis reveals a pattern-based outcome that discloses a variety of inter-related factors within the social network ecosystem that stimulate and sometimes stifle youth entrepreneurship, primarily through the active agency of social-cultural capital. Practical implications: Entrepreneurial ecosystem contextual differences between Malaysia and Laos demonstrate the unifying factor of social-cultural capital through social network in stimulating youth entrepreneurship and unveiling practical similarities and differences that can be used to promote youth entrepreneurial endeavors among varying sovereign socio-economic contexts in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Countries). Originality/value: This study specifically focuses on the unambiguous contextual differences of two sovereign entrepreneurship ecosystems. Contextual differences may not necessarily demarcate further the gulf of differences within and between two sovereign entrepreneurship ecosystems but, on the contrary, may close the gap through the dynamic role of social-cultural capital via social network ties in youth entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper describes the entrepreneurial ecosystems of three public research universities involved in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Midwest I-Corps TM (trademark symbol) Node. It presents a synthesis of programming, functional structure, commonly referenced university metrics and their limitations in measuring impact on commercialization and regional development. Design/methodology/approach: Based on current literature, university data and discussions with entrepreneurship leaders at the University of Michigan/Ann Arbor, University of Illinois/Urbana Champaign and Purdue University, this paper provides an overview and analysis of entrepreneurial resources and education initiatives. Findings: University contributions to entrepreneurial ecosystems can be described with respect to infrastructure and leadership, technology and talent and culture of innovation. Four main university entities are responsible for driving entrepreneurship initiatives. Identification of these entities, their respective activities and their outcomes allows us to propose a framework for analyzing and measuring university entrepreneurial ecosystem impact. Practical implications: The paper describes the variety of university-based entrepreneurial initiatives believed to contribute to university entrepreneurial vibrancy and ultimately regional development. It identifies ecosystem stakeholders and provides a framework for examining their role and impact for continuous development. Originality/value: The research complements prior reviews and empirical studies of university-wide entrepreneurial ecosystems by focusing on programming within and across institutions according to four dimensions (academic, research administration, technology transfer and community engagement) with respect to technology and talent development. It describes similarities across institutions and limitations associated with measuring impact. It provides a foundation for future empirical research related to the impact of NSF I-Corps and entrepreneurial programming in academic settings. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Since Smith (1776) took consideration to human capital as an asset of economic value, academic interest has focused on the economic effects of human capital. In 1931, Schumpeter called for a focus on the individual entrepreneur or the creative destructor with his/her motives, wishes, aspirations and activities when dealing with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs. Along these lines, this paper focuses on an in-depth investigation of the domain of human capital in Isenberg's entrepreneurship ecosystem. It captures the entrepreneurial mindset of the highly complex individual as a requisite for entrepreneurial success and ultimately, for business growth and development. The increasing literature debating human capital confirms the relevance of locating and refining the factors for entrepreneurial success. Consequently, this paper improves the roadmap of entrepreneurship ecosystems by adding the innate skills and conceptualising four generic archetypes, the local entrepreneur, the global entrepreneur, the incremental entrepreneur, and the radical entrepreneur, based on the combination of short/long education and narrow/broad labour. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a framework of the elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the context of born global start-ups. The study also applies this framework to uncover the ecosystem elements that impact start-ups during their initial phases of discovery and validation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used an online survey questionnaire sent out to several Estonian start-ups. Based on the responses, a dataset was developed and analysed using STATA and t-test methodology. Findings: The analysis resulted in the identification of seven systemic ecosystem elements as the main factors impacting the launch and ten elements impacting the growth of born global start-ups. The systemic elements that comprise the ecosystem’s strengths and weaknesses were also identified. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional nature of the survey method and the single-country context are noted as limitations of the study and offer future research potential for longitudinal settings, for mixed method studies and for comparative country data. Practical implications: The study suggests that start-ups should function in a more collective manner to create platforms, promote one another’s products and services where possible and launch collective initiatives to enhance their visibility in the global context. Born globals should engage with their local entrepreneurial ecosystem, while remaining aware of its relative strengths and weaknesses for supporting internationalisation. Social implications: Although the local ecosystem involves many stakeholders, this study helps identify key stakeholders that should be focused on by the government. Doing so will help create an increasingly comprehensive ecosystem at the national level – one that functions efficiently in supporting growth-seeking enterprises such as born globals. Originality/value: This study combines the two research streams of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and born globals by directly connecting them with systemic elements. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to combine the two, thus making an added contribution by highlighting macro- and micro-viewpoints, with the former lacking in research on born globals and the latter in research on ecosystems. Thus, the present study helps in bringing venture creation and local ecosystem development research closer to each other. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore the dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems with both rural and urban features, as well as the varied system requirements of differing types of entrepreneurs within such an ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach: Using a mixed-methods case study approach, the study examined the Roanoke–Blacksburg region in western Virginia. Researchers conducted quantitative analysis of entrepreneurial metrics and network relationships, as well as qualitative analysis of data collected through entrepreneur surveys and stakeholder interviews. Findings: Findings suggest entrepreneurs of different types faced disparate challenges and uneven access to resources and networks. Innovation-driven “gazelle” enterprises (IDEs) had numerous growth-related resource needs, including angel, venture and scale-up funding; prototyping equipment and facilities; and translational research by local universities. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) required more entrepreneurial education programming, subsidized main street office space and clearer pathways through the government regulatory system. A key finding was also concerned with the different ways by which IDEs and SMEs accessed key resources within the ecosystem, illustrated through social network analysis, and supported through qualitative feedback. Research limitations/implications: Study findings were limited by a relatively low survey response rate from some entrepreneur demographic segments, particularly minorities. Originality/value: The study represents an in-depth, multi-methods approach that offers insight into two under-researched areas in the ecosystem literature: the dynamics of urban – rural ecosystems and the varied system requirements of different entrepreneur types. The paper includes three overarching recommendations for policy and practice: improved collection and sharing of regional metrics; differentiated approaches to entrepreneurial support based on entrepreneur type; and enhanced efforts to advance inclusive entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims to analyse the maturity of the Brazilian entrepreneurial ecosystem based on the opinions and insights from business incubator professionals. To this end, a survey was performed with 74 professionals who published at least one paper related to this topic in Brazil. The maturity analysis was based on a theoretical model with variables to be measured for the incubators in six major constructs: support, government, finance, human capital, culture and market. Data was analysed through structural equation modelling, which allowed for a statistic validation of the model. With this validation, it was possible to analyse the maturity notes assigned to each variable and conclude that the Brazilian entrepreneurial ecosystem has an intermediate level of maturity, with some possible improvements. The originality of this study lies both in the assessment carried out and in the use of this particular statistical technique for this purpose. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Research on the entrepreneurial university has been receiving increased attention in recent years. The growing literature stock has been leading to a rather unstructured research status quo, characterised by foci on particular elements and actors of the entrepreneurial university. Hence, our paper aims to systematically integrate the fragmented literature on entrepreneurial universities. Relying on the stakeholder theory, our paper provides a stakeholder-based conceptualisation. We identify seven research streams and devised an integrative systematic university-centred view on the entrepreneurial university itself and its core stakeholders within its organisational boundaries and beyond, such as researchers, firms, the economy and society. We illustrate and discuss the findings and conclude with a future research agenda. Due to its systemic nature, our integrative stakeholder-based conceptualisation of the literature on the entrepreneurial university enables the identification of important future research directions that particularly address the linkages between the stakeholder groups and the overall ecosystem.

Universities are now viewed as key economic actors within regions and are central actors in shaping and influencing entrepreneurial ecosystems. This has meant that universities now have to become more entrepreneurial in offerings, outlook and culture. However, a core actor in this process who is often overlooked is the academic. The ability of an academic to effectively transfer knowledge to industry is key to universities achieving their entrepreneurial mission and ambition. This paper explores the changing roles of academics to identify key distinctions between entrepreneurial academics and academic entrepreneurs. This is done through a systematic literature review spanning 25 years drawing on selected high impact journals in innovation, entrepreneurship and higher education studies. We categorise the types of activity that academics typically engage in and identify the motivations and challenges they face. From this, we identify two types of academics, the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur. We posit that there is a need for both types of academics to contribute to the success of the entrepreneurial university and conclude by outlining some avenues for future research.

In the literature on entrepreneurship, there is an ongoing debate about the impact of regional factors on the entrepreneurial process. To date, most of the empirical work on the influence of regional characteristics on entrepreneurship has focused on developed countries, while empirical work that analyses the regional determinants of micro entrepreneurship in rural areas of emerging markets remains scare. This paper uses three-level binary-logistic random intercept models to analyse the effects of explanatory factors at different levels on micro entrepreneurship in rural Vietnam. Our analyses show that identifying the motivation behind starting a micro enterprise is a good way to split entrepreneurship into two groups: namely opportunity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship, which are influenced by very different explanatory factors at different levels. We find evidence that in rural areas of emerging markets, the individual level dominates with regard to explaining both opportunity- and necessity-driven entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the regional level has a significant impact, albeit only on opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Transnational Entrepreneurship (TE) is an increasingly important phenomenon, symptomatic for a globalised world with a large extent of migrants and interchanges between their countries of origin and residence. Our article deploys a unique data set which compares TE for two different national contexts and institutional settings: Chile and Germany. Using data from 2016 and 2017 Adult Populations Surveys (APS) of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), we relate the probability of being an opportunity-driven entrepreneur with the condition of being a transnational entrepreneur. Our findings suggest that varying institutional settings attract or form different types of TE. While Chile seems to attract mainly opportunity-driven TE, TE in Germany reveals strong evidence of necessity-driven TE. In addition, we explore different traits on the probability of being involved in TE based on the presumption that transnational entrepreneurs show signs of higher opportunity recognition and network embeddedness and can thereby be a major driver of entrepreneurial ecosystems as well as act as linkages between different national systems. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The background of the article lies in South Eastern Finland, in Lappeenranta, where an active University campus has attracted a group of ICT startups as well as SME's in the field to collaboration. The novel education approach also has another remarkable role as a developer and source of innovation. An experimental development ecosystem (EDE), where learning of knowledge, skills and character are combined, is presented in the article. Also future paths of the EDE are discussed. Companies in the ICT field worldwide are in constant need of competent experts who are ready to adopt the new tools and, at the same time, have an entrepreneurial mindset. We argue that inspiring students to learn through appropriate learning methods and providing them with a modern learning environment comes first. ICT tools, applications and systems to support learning objectives come second. The model presented in the article has been studied for some years as action research. The learning methods that have been found beneficial in IT and marketing bachelor education have been spread to other bachelor and master study programs as well. Results from the data show that students who study as team entrepreneurs have learned content knowledge, meta-skills and reflection skills via the learner-centric methods used in EDE. They have also been inspired to employ new ICT tools and applications to support their learning and project work. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems. All Rights Reserved.

OECD and the EU have have shown themselves to be inclined towards the inclusion of the " entrepreneurial initiative " in the various stages of education. In 2000, training for the acquisition of entrepreneurial culture became one of the central pillars that should guide the educational policies of European countries. With RD 1147/2011, of 29th July, the professional module for business and entrepreneurship was introduced. Law 14/2013, of 27 September, on support for entrepreneurs and their internationalisation, also includes measures for young people to acquire, through the education system, the skills and abilities required for entrepreneurship. Moreover, the European institutions consider "the promotion of the social economy as a key driver of economic and social development in Europe" (Resolution of the European Council of Ministers for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs of 7 December 2015). On 23 May 2017, the governments of 11 EU countries signed the 'Madrid Declaration', in which they stressed the relevance of promoting and including entrepreneurship under social economy formulas in the curricula at different stages of education. Social entrepreneurship' is attracting increasing interest, given the need to help generate value by responding to social needs, i.e. economic, social and environmental challenges, by seeking innovative solutions in line with the priorities of the EU 2020 Strategy. This paper analyzes the main characteristics required of a social entrepreneurship project, as well as the concretion of "the creation of sustainable value", both in social entrepreneurship projects that have the recognition of reference organizations, as in new projects undertaken by university students based on the definitions and differentiating features that are obtained as a conclusion in the projects carried out by the Cátedra de Emprendimiento Social UCM-Santander. © 2018 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Purpose: The entrepreneurial process is a result of an interaction between an individual entrepreneur and the surrounding entrepreneurial ecosystem. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether US metropolitan areas with disproportionately high shares of entrepreneurs are systematically linked to particular attributes of the entrepreneurial support system? Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, non-farm proprietorship (NFP) employment data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis is used as a dependent variable proxy for entrepreneurship. NFP data are widely used in the entrepreneurship literature. Data on all independent variables were obtained from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics by metropolitan area and subject to a stepwise linear regression analysis. Findings: The relative share of NFP employment by metropolitan area exhibited a strong positive relationship with percentage of employment in finance, insurance and real estate, median age, percentage of Hispanic population and median home value. It is argued that the combination of significant predictors captures both out-of-necessity self-employment (e.g. low-skilled Hispanic and aging populations) and a self-employment of opportunity (e.g. access to capital). Practical implications: Public policies focused on nurturing entrepreneurial ecosystems must account for these divergent explanatory frameworks when attempting to encourage NFP employment. Originality/value: The paper has an explicit spatial context that tends to be overlooked in the traditional entrepreneurship literature. The focus on out-of-necessity versus opportunity-based entrepreneurship, and how it is shaped by some key predictors at the metropolitan scale, is a relatively new angle. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims to explore the system of entrepreneurial learning in Indonesian business Incubator and identify their success factors to support the entrepreneurs. This study is qualitative research using case approach. We collect data from six incubators in West Java Indonesia and interviewing tenants and person in charge of the incubation management. In general, we found three similar stages of incubation assistance to encourage and support entrepreneurial process for their tenants: pre-incubation, incubation, and post-incubation. Even though the condition is not in an ideal, the respondents highlight some influent factors of the incubation performance in Indonesia; 1) government support for incubation program related in funding, infrastructure and policies toward the entrepreneurship ecosystem; 2) networking with financial institution; 3) Support from university and research centre; 4) Social environment of incubators. © 2018 Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how students, full-time and part-time, may be supported in becoming ambidextrous - developing "intrapreneurial" skills and capabilities, as well as being introduced to more typical "entrepreneurial" activities. It is proposed that both perspectives will be necessary for future graduates. Design/methodology/approach: The paper highlights the fast-changing nature of the economic and employment context and the future requirements for graduate skills. It analyses and evaluates a framework of curricular and extra-curricular activities which has been developed to address future skills needs. The paper uses a case study to illustrate the issue. Findings: The paper concludes that with increasingly flexible career paths, there is a need for graduates to be prepared for portfolio careers in which they move between employment and self-employment. The development of an independent mindset which can identify and exploit innovation is therefore important. Practical implications: The paper outlines an approach that has been implemented in a UK higher education institution to the development of innovation skills which is responsive to a wider range of students than the conventional cohort of young, full-time students. Originality/value: The paper highlights the importance of designing educational experiences which directly address students' situations and experiences. It also identifies the role of work-based research in the development of an innovative mindset. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This report focuses on data gathered from a large-scale, systematic survey of Stanford alumni, faculty and selected staff in 2011 to assess the university's economic impact based on its involvement in entrepreneurship. The report describes Stanford's role in fostering entrepreneurship, discusses how the Stanford environment encourages creativity and entrepreneurship and details best practices for creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem. The report on the 2011 survey, estimates that 39,900 active companies can trace their roots to Stanford. If these companies collectively formed an independent nation, its estimated economy would be the world's 10th largest. Extrapolating from survey results, those companies have created an estimated 5.4 million jobs and generate annual world revenues of $2.7 trillion. © 2018 Now Publishers Inc. All rights reserved.

Do business accelerators affect new venture performance? We investigate this question in the context of Start-Up Chile, an ecosystem accelerator. We focus on two treatment conditions typically found in business accelerators: basic services of funding and coworking space, and additional entrepreneurship schooling. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that schooling bundled with basic services can significantly increase new venture performance. In contrast, we find no evidence that basic services affect performance on their own. Our results are most relevant for ecosystem accelerators that attract young and early-stage businesses and suggest that entrepreneurial capital matters in new ventures. © The Author 2017.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies.All rights reserved.

This paper examines the role of investments by angel groups across a heterogeneous set of 21 countries with varying entrepreneurship ecosystems. Exploiting quasi-random assignment of deals around the groups’ funding thresholds, we find a positive impact of funding on firm growth, performance, survival, and follow-on fundraising, which is independent of the level of venture activity and entrepreneur-friendliness in the country. However, the maturity of startups that apply for funding (and are ultimately funded) inversely correlates with the entrepreneurship-friendliness of the country. This may reflect self-censoring by early-stage firms that do not expect to receive funding in these environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the changing pattern and characteristics of international financial flows in the emerging entrepreneurial ecosystems of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), provide a novel taxonomy to classify and analyze them, and discuss how such investments contribute to competence building and sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: In an exploratory study, the authors analyze the characteristics of international venture capital investors and the start-ups receiving funding in Kenya and map their interaction. The authors proceed by developing a novel taxonomy, classifying investors according to their main rationales (for-profit-for-impact), and start-ups according to the locus of needs and markets addressed by the start-up (local-global) and the locus of the start-ups capacity and knowledge (local-global). Findings: The authors observe a new type of mainly western investors who support innovative ideas in SSA by identifying and investing in domestically developed technical innovations with the potential to address global market needs. The authors find such innovations to be mainly developed at the intersect of global and local knowledge. Originality/value: The authors shed light on the – up to now – under-researched emerging phenomenon of international high-tech investments in SSA, and develop a novel taxonomy of technology investments in low-income countries, guiding further research on the conditions, impact, practical, and policy implications of this new form of finance flows. © 2018, Daniel Stefan Hain and Roman Jurowetzki.

In recent years, universities have seen an increasing amount of activity in entrepreneurship and commercialization, not only for students, but for faculty as well. Traditionally, these initiatives have been separate, such that programs and curriculum have been focused on supporting just students or just faculty. In 2012, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the NSF I-Corps™ program, an innovative funding program that not only offered principle investigators (PIs) funding, but also exposed PIs to an innovation/entrepreneurship curriculum as well. The University of Michigan (U-M) was one of the first two NSF I-Corps™ Nodes funded in 2012 and has leveraged the program to catalyze the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This paper describes the growth of this entrepreneurial ecosystem since 1983, the call of entrepreneurship in the U-M College of Engineering and describes the role the U-M NSF I-Corps™ program has played across the university. The paper concludes with lessons learned and recommendations to administrators and policy makers considering more active promotion of academic entrepreneurship and commercialization in universities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Growing evidence suggests entrepreneurial ecosystems are a potent engine for economic and community development. Prior research has identified an ecosystem’s culture as serving a critical role in its creation and functioning. However, it is not clear how the cultural forces in entrepreneurial ecosystems develop and are shaped by individuals, organizational actors, and ecosystem-level institutions. Drawing from institutional theory and theories of multiple logic organizations (i.e., hybrids), this paper combines entrepreneurship and management research to argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems are influenced by two dominant institutional logics: entrepreneurial-market and community. By combining both logics, hybrid support organizations, such as incubators, accelerators, and small business development centers, play a unique role in entrepreneurial ecosystems by exposing participants to the two guiding logics. Furthermore, it is argued that intra-ecosystem variation among hybrid support organizations in the dominance of entrepreneurial-market and community logics, will result in a diversity of entrepreneurship within an ecosystem. This theorizing contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurial ecosystems by shedding light on the role institutional logics and hybrid support organizations play in ecosystem formation, structuring, and function and by explaining the genesis of the cultural values that guide ecosystem participants. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This article looks at the evolution of university–industry collaboration (UIC) policies in Japan since the mid-1990s to the present and analyses their role in shaping the country’s innovation ecosystem. UIC policies are examined within a multidimensional innovation policy framework that encompasses five Science and Technology Basic Plans and a vast array of support measures for venture business, intellectual property, innovation networks and business promotion, all reflecting an extensive top-down government intervention with ambitious goals. A dense network of UIC centres has been established throughout the country, mostly in universities, and these centres are tightly embedded in regional innovation structures. In spite of the sustained government policy intervention, Japan lags behind the United States and Europe in a ranking of the top 20 global ecosystems and has some of the world’s lowest entrepreneurial indicators, as defined by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. The authors argue that a likely cause for the lag is Japan’s slow and still incomplete transition from a ‘traditional’ innovation system to a modern innovation ecosystem with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and culture, effective intermediaries between university and industry, high absorptive capacity in companies using academic research, cross-boundary mobility of workforce and ideas and global outreach. The experience of Osaka University and Hokkaido University, two UIC leaders in Japan and internationally, supports this hypothesis. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

The aim of this paper is to understand the extent to which the start-up motives can influence social-ecological resilience in community-based entrepreneurship setting. The case study approach was used to study five coastal communities in northwestern Sri Lanka. Shrimp farmers’ start-up motives include both the desire to capitalize on opportunities to utilize their resources and skills (opportunity-driven) and the need to establish satisfactory sources of income (necessity-driven). They have come up with diverse entrepreneurial responses to face various stressors and shocks by using their existing capital types and their willingness for collaboration. Farmers’ coping capacity is demonstrated through their individual responses whereas adaptive and transformative capacities are demonstrated mostly through their community cooperative work. Findings also reveal that the start-up motives of small-scale shrimp farmers are less influential on their social-ecological resilience in the community setting. Instead, the key to social-ecological resilience lies with the understanding of the nature of stressors and their commitment for collective action. © 2017

The focus of this study is ‘hidden entrepreneurs’ who bridge formal and informal economies. While their business activities are legal, the governance and ownership structures of their organizations are illegal. This qualitative study draws upon institutional theory to illuminate the emergence of international hidden entrepreneurs in Oman as an unintended response to institutional configurations, and to examine its perceived effects on the domestic entrepreneurial ecosystem. Hidden practices, shaped by the dynamics of institutional environments, are perceived negatively by policy makers and domestic entrepreneurs, but offer potential contributions for entrepreneurial development. In-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and stakeholders reveal how hidden practices are shaped by the dynamics of regulatory and social institutions. Loopholes, or flawed institutional configurations, and prevailing sociocultural factors drive the emergence of hidden practices. The study contributes to informal entrepreneurship literature and policy making through highlighting the relevance of international entrepreneurs in enabling entrepreneurial ecosystem development. © 2017 European Academy of Management

In this article we examine the entrepreneurialtendencies among science and technology (S & T) graduates in India. The study was carried out to understand the entrepreneurial psyche among S & T students from India-based institutions of national repute, i.e. Indian Institutes of Technology and National Institutes of Technology. We found that there is a low level of interest among students to pursue an entrepreneurial career. In the psychological context, factors such as self-efficacy, locus of control, innovativeness, achievement orientation were found to positively influence students' entrepreneurial aspirations, but surprisingly not the risk taking propensity. Moreover, environmental factors such as existence of vital resources were found to motivate entrepreneurship. On policy implication per se, our finding concludes with suggestions to impart entrepreneurial knowledge through programmes especially designed for S & T graduates. Additionally, in the context of entrepreneurial ecosystem, policy makers can pave new dimensions by creating an environment that serves as a catalyst for high-tech venturing.

Unemployment levels in South Africa have reached astronomical levels. This has spurred the government to fund entrepreneurship initiatives such as the Enterprise and Supplier Development programmes. Thus it is vital to enable and create entrepreneurial ecosystems that attract, cultivate, and sustain entrepreneurs. This paper explores how entrepreneurial firms use external actors for value creation in an entrepreneurial ecosystem through intermediaries. The focus is on how an intermediary organisation can facilitate value co-creation.

Embedded between the broader fields of social and digital entrepreneurship, the concept of 'smart cities’ can be conceptualized as a domain that is currently pre-paradigmatic—that is, one in which multiple yet unaligned models exist, marked by the absence of a single dominant one. Despite such shortcomings, there is a reflective similarity across ecosystems as the various players attempt to converge on a common understanding of the term smart city. The common objective of smart city implementation is to spark economic growth and social development, facilitated by collaborative dialogue and innovations in technology. We integrate theoretical lenses to explore the roles played by ecosystem actors, stakeholders, and socioeconomic and political agents in creating economic value and solving societal problems—particularly highlighting opportunities and challenges to bottom-up innovation from local entrepreneurs. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

Governmental development strategies focus on entrepreneurship as a major resource for the economic development of indigenous peoples. While initiatives and programs are locally based, there is a debate in the academic literature about how contextual factors affect the identification of indigenous entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and integrate indigenous entrepreneurship literature to identify the main indigenous entrepreneurship models. Thus, a systematic literature review was conducted. In total, 25 relevant articles were identified in selected electronic databases and manual searches of Australian Business Deans Council ranked journals from January 1, 1995 to the end of 2016. Using a systematic analysis of sociocultural contexts and locations, the paper proposed that a typology of contextualized indigenous entrepreneurship models was possible, that were classified as urban, remote and rural. The parameters of these models, and their potential theoretical and practical applications to the study and practice of indigenous entrepreneurship ecosystems were also outlined. © 2018 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Given the high visibility of venture capital and private equity (VC/PE) in business news, entrepreneurs may be misled on the role and relative size of this financing model. In reality however, VC/PE is quite difficult to obtain, particularly for young entrepreneurs. With this in mind, I assess seven popular models for financing that may be of interest to entrepreneurial students. These seven models include: self-funding/bootstrapping; friends, family, and colleagues; banks; accelerators; angel investors; peer-to-peer (P2P) lending; and crowdfunding. Each model is summarized and evaluated for their advantages and disadvantages. A discussion of relevant resources for each model is also provided. © 2017 Forrest Wright.

This study focuses on regional entrepreneurial ecosystems and offers a complex model of start-ups, Regional Entrepreneurship and Development Index (REDI) and six domains of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (culture, formal institutions, infrastructure and amenities, IT, Melting Pot and demand). Altogether they capture the contextual features of socioeconomic, institutional and information environment in cities. To explain variations in entrepreneurship in a cross-section of 70 European cities, we utilize exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling for regional systems of entrepreneurship using individual perception surveys by Eurostat and the REDI. This study supports policymakers and scholars in development of new policies conducive to regional systems of innovation and entrepreneurship and serves as a basis for future research on urban entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The aim of the paper is to present a new performance measurement concept and a relevant methodology for entrepreneurial universities which serves the ideal of transforming into an innovative one and contributing to the economic development and societal benefits. The current Entrepreneurial and Innovative Universities index which is in place in Turkey is evaluated according to the available perspectives in excellence of Higher Education Institutions and domains for advancement are being discussed. Furthermore, standard evaluation of the universities with ranking methodology is argued proposing a conceptual framework based on non-linear dynamics of systems thinking. Consequently, further directions in research, policy and university management are delivered putting forward the view that the entrepreneurial university ecosystem requires innovative approach in all aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the entrepreneurial economy of today, it is not the multinational firms which are the predominant driver in the creation of new knowledge, but the individual entrepreneur. Correspondingly, new ventures of small size are leading in commercializing new knowledge and transferring it to the market. This economic shift has been reflected by broad entrepreneurship policies, which aim at supporting the individual on the challenge of a high-growth start-up. However, prior experience shows that uniform entrepreneurship policies do not address the individual needs in different countries and ecosystems adequately. In this paper, we study the performance of academic spin-offs that received public funding from the German EXIST Business Start-Up Grant, a support program which aims at increasing the number of innovative start-ups from academia. Using a control group matching approach, we provide evidence that these start-ups are smaller by two full time equivalent employees, generate 1.7 times higher losses and have a nearly three times lower return on capital than science-based entrepreneurial firms with comparable characteristics in the first 5 years after foundation. We interpret these results to be primarily caused by the inferior financial contracting structure of the program compared to private venture capital funding and by the resulting adverse selection and incentive effects on the entrepreneurs. The evidence calls for rethinking public interventions in a national system of entrepreneurship. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The growth of entrepreneurial ecosystems is becoming increasingly dynamic. We introduce the concept of collision density, defined as the potential frequency of interdisciplinary interactions, to explain this phenomenon. We develop hypotheses about the impact of collision density on the growth of entrepreneurial ecosystems. This impact is hypothesized to be amplified by the presence of angel financing. We find support for our hypotheses in panel data from 89 urban entrepreneurial ecosystems of 92,229 investments between 2007 and 2014. We conclude with discussions of the the implications for research and practice. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This paper examines how social entrepreneurship, at both the firm and institutional levels, fosters innovation and economic development. It draws on concepts from national innovation systems (NIS), complexity, ecosystems, and social entrepreneurship research to develop a framework for forming innovation ecosystems via social entrepreneurship. The framework is especially relevant for new market creation in renewable energy for rural and bottom of the pyramid (BOP) populations. Case studies from the renewable energy sector in India support the framework. The paper suggests that creating a robust innovation ecosystem requires the following mechanisms at the national level to provide the supporting infrastructure: (1) creation of new institutions; (2) policies to generate demand; (3) institutional support for linkages to build capabilities. Key mechanisms at the micro-level include: (1) facilitating the entry of social entrepreneurs to serve the needs of rural populations; (2) use of new technology platforms to diffuse entrepreneurial skills and enhance community interactions; and (3) establishing linkages with external organizations to enable resource acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Currently there is an attention in research and practise on entrepreneurial ecosystems, and how these, often using incubators, could support sustainable development through new firm start-ups. Despite the popularity of incubators in the literature and practise, few studies have focused on sustainable incubators in general or, more specifically, on processes that ensure a steady flow of tenants. Thus, this paper investigates how sustainable incubators ensures their inflow of tenants, how they organize their activities and whether the incubator environment affect tenant recruitment. A case study approach analysing the sustainability oriented incubator Green Garage Berlin have been used to generate an understanding of selection and recruitment processes as well the influence of external environments. The results show that regional and inter-regional co-operation, together with a well-planned, structured pre-incubation process, are requirements for securing an inflow of tenants to sustainable incubators. Incubator reputation and sufficient long term funding is also a key to success. A good practice case as Green Garage cannot simply be replicated, but require openness to continue the learning process and adapting the knowledge to be transferred to local conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The promotion of entrepreneurship requires an ecosystem where Higher Education Institutions (HEI) hold a crucial position in collaboration with all stakeholders. Such systems require a high degree of interaction, involving institutions, people and processes that work together with the goal of creating entrepreneurial ventures that are mutually beneficial and self-sustaining. The university setting may be an ideal starting point such that it would serve to recognise potential entre-preneurs within communities and play critical roles in developing and supporting thriving entrepreneurial ecosystems. They may serve as conveners and collaborators for entrepreneurs and support communities to promote the economic development of the region. Such energy derived from university promoted environments in which learning is encouraged and discoveries are made reflects on Higher Educational aims. Obstacles in this role of universities include a lack of provision of the best instructional methods and venues by universities, programmes and curricula that are not conducive to promoting entrepreneurship, a lack of information on entrepreneurial activities in the informal sector and a dearth of appropriate role models within both universities and the business environment. It is therefore apparent that universities are the missing link for the development of a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in South Africa. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.

According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2015 Global Report (GEM, 2015), South Africa (SA) had the lowest youth entrepreneurial propensity of only 23.3 per cent. Among the sub-Saharan African countries surveyed, Uganda recorded the highest youth entrepreneurs with 55.6 per cent of the youth population involved in nascent, new or established businesses. South Africa had the lowest youth entrepreneurship participation of only 12.8 per cent, and recorded the highest level of non-entrepreneurial youth with 63.9 per cent of the youth population (GEM, 2015). According to Puuka (2014), SA has not yet unleashed its entrepreneurial potential. Despite the importance of small- and medium-sized enterprises for the economy and job creation, SA’s established business rate is only 2.3 per cent—the second lowest in the world. South Africa needs new job creators to solve the job crisis. A new philosophy and approach to education in general are required; more specifically in a higher education sub-system of universities of technology in SA that is designed to lead to work opportunity-enhancing outcomes. The Central University of Technology, Free State (CUT), SA has, in line, with its Vision 2020 that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic developments set a goal of transforming CUT into an innovative and entrepreneurial university, and of becoming a robust agent for socio-economic development in the city and the region. This article gives an overview of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem established at the University, the city and the region; the creation of an increasingly robust innovation and entrepreneurship pipeline; and initiatives that started in 2012 in the field of curriculum innovation, and innovation and entrepreneurship education later in 2014. These initiatives, together with international examples cited, show that universities could pursue the path to innovation and entrepreneurship education with outcomes that impact the broader society. True to the universities of technology’s general philosophy of education, the path involves innovation, entrepreneurship education, research, idea generation and technology transfer. Based on a literature study of global perspectives on entrepreneurship education and lessons to be learnt, the paper discusses the enablers to promote entrepreneurship education at CUT and key elements of the University’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy. Furthermore, it shares successes and some challenges of these efforts at CUT, which are evident in the increasing national recognition of our innovation and entrepreneurship activities. The impact of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship ecosystem on the knowledge production from CUT in the past few years are also illustrated. The article concludes that the overarching challenge to ensuring high impact and relevance is dependent on the development and successful implementation of an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem, buy-in of all internal and external stakeholders and dedicated resources. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.

This work presents REPITA (Research-Ecosystem-People-Intellectual Property-Transfer-Alignment), a prescriptive and repeatable model for successful technology-based academic entrepreneurship, synthesized from research of academic entrepreneurship in developing economy conditions. In this work, we identify three deficiencies in Mexico's entrepreneurship ecosystem: research skills, high technology, and technology transfer. We then present a solution that has been recognized by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for fueling high-tech university spin-offs with science and technology doctoral research. Lessons from 48 spin-off projects are synthesized in the newly proposed REPITA model, which prescribes connecting a basic research platform to applications, catalyzing the entrepreneurship ecosystem with resources and incentives, combining highly specialized people in entrepreneurial teams, setting generous and flexible intellectual property policies for the knowledge economy, transferring technology per entry and exit strategies, and aligning technology and business incubation. Finally, we propose a tool that presents academic entrepreneurship theories in an actionable format for university administrators and entrepreneurs. These results are not a theoretical framework on their own, but rather a real-world organizational model based on theory for impelling technology-based, academic spin-offs with economic impact. Taken together, this contribution may be useful to practitioners and provocative for researchers. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

This study focuses on start-up entrepreneurs on the move—in coordination with an array of other actors—as they weave and are woven into transnational networks. Central to this study is a shift from activity to mobility systems. Building on technical communication scholarship, the frame integrates actor networks and activity theory knotworks. Disrupting workplace and national container models (methodological nationalism), the analysis is grounded in a study of Israeli start-up entrepreneurs. Dubbed the Start-Up Nation, Israel contains more start-ups per capita than any other country in the world, with its high-tech industry made up of a dense ecosystem of conferences, accelerators, meetups, social media, and coworking spaces. Tracing actants’ trajectories across this social field, the author argues for a conceptualization of entrepreneurs as knotworkers who mobilize genres, modes, languages, and spaces. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

The entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) literature has attracted much attention, especially in policy circles. However, the concept suffers from a number of shortcomings: (1) it lacks a clear analytical framework that makes explicit what is cause and what is effect in an EE; (2) while being a systemic concept, the EE has not yet fully exploited insights from network theory, and it is not always clear in what way the proposed elements are connected in an EE; (3) it remains a challenge what institutions (and at what spatial scale) impact on the structure and performance of EE; (4) studies have often focused on the EE in single regions or clusters, but lack a comparative and multi-scalar perspective and (5) the EE literature tends to provide a static framework taking a snapshot of EE without considering systematically their evolution over time. For each of these shortcomings, we make a number of suggestions to take up in future research on EE. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems has quickly established itself as one of the latest ‘fads’ in entrepreneurship research. At face value, this kind of systemic approach to entrepreneurship offers a new and distinctive path for scholars and policy makers to help understand and foster growth-oriented entrepreneurship. However, its lack of specification and conceptual limitations has undoubtedly hindered our understanding of these complex organisms. Indeed, the rapid adoption of the concept has tended to overlook the heterogeneous nature of ecosystems. This paper provides a critical review and conceptualisation of the ecosystems concept: it unpacks the dynamics of the concept; outlines its theoretical limitations; measurement approaches and use in policy-making. It sets out a preliminary taxonomy of different archetypal ecosystems. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial ecosystems are a highly variegated, multi-actor and multi-scalar phenomenon, requiring bespoke policy interventions. © 2017, The Author(s).

A significant gap exists in the conceptualization of entrepreneurship in the digital age. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for studying entrepreneurship in the digital age by integrating two well-established concepts: the digital ecosystem and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The integration of these two ecosystems helps us better understand the interactions of agents and users that incorporate insights of consumers’ individual and social behavior. The Digital Entrepreneurial Ecosystem framework consists of four concepts: digital infrastructure governance, digital user citizenship, digital entrepreneurship, and digital marketplace. The paper develops propositions for each of the four concepts and provides a theoretical framework of multisided platforms to better understand the digital entrepreneurial ecosystem. Finally, it outlines a new research agenda to fill the gap in our understanding of entrepreneurship in the digital age. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

We propose an empirical framework for assessing the vibrancy and trajectory of regional entrepreneurial ecosystems. We apply this framework to study the US National Capital Region’s localized cluster of biotechnology-related entrepreneurship by building our analysis around a set of indicators of ecosystem vitality proposed by Stangler and Bell-Masterson (2015). This application constitutes an initial attempt at mapping the dynamics of an industry cluster within the adaptive life cycle of a wider regional ecosystem. We find that the biotechnology cluster in the National Capital Region entered a “reorientation” stage in the early 2000s, building up stored energy, capital, and connectedness in non-research-oriented activities. An increasing regional presence of large biotech firms in the past 5 years, a highly active and diverse start-up sector, increasing merger and acquisition activity, and declines in regional public funding for medical and clinical trials all suggest a transition of entrepreneurial activity in the region from a dynamic driven by federal research spillovers to one increasingly driven by private sector actors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The current rise in research on entrepreneurial ecosystems notes that many questions are still unanswered. We, therefore, theorize about a unique paradox for entrepreneurs trying to establish legitimacy for their new ventures within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem; that is, when pursuing opportunities with high levels of technological or market newness, entrepreneurs confront a significant challenge in legitimizing their venture within an entrepreneurial ecosystem, while those entrepreneurs pursuing ventures using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets have a much easier path to garnering legitimacy within that ecosystem. However, the diffusion of that legitimacy beyond the ecosystem will be wider and more far-reaching for those pursuing the newer elements compared to those using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets, thus, creating a paradox of venture legitimation. Prior research outlines approaches for new venture legitimacy but it is unclear when these approaches should be applied within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem. To address this paradox, we integrate ideas from the entrepreneurship and innovation literature with insights from the legitimacy literature to describe how different types of venture newness employ different legitimation strategies which results in different levels of legitimacy diffusion beyond an ecosystem. We conclude with a discussion of our concepts and offer suggestions for future research efforts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This paper employs Frederick Jackson Turner’s Frontier Thesis of American democracy to construct a framework for understanding the U.S. university campus as an entrepreneurial ecosystem. One question that immediately comes to mind when studying ecosystem performance is what the proper unit of analysis is: the country, the state, the city, the region, or something smaller, like an incubator or accelerator? This paper suggests that the open, innovative American frontier that closed at the end of the twentieth century has reemerged in the entrepreneurial economy on the U.S. campus. The contemporary campus entrepreneurial ecosystem offers the characteristics of Turner’s frontier: available assets, liberty, and diversity while creating opportunity, and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. A case study of the University of Chicago explores governance of the campus as an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the output produced by that campus ecosystem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

In this paper, we propose a method by which the entrepreneurial ecosystem, if present, reveals itself in the data. We first follow the literature and define the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a multidimensional set of interacting factors that moderate the effect of entrepreneurial activity on economic growth. The quality of such an ecosystem, by its multidimensionality, is impossible to measure directly. But so defined, we argue that variation in entrepreneurial ecosystem quality should result in variation in the estimated marginal effect of entrepreneurial activity on economic growth. Testing for such variation is possible using a combination of a multilevel growth regression and latent class analysis. We motivate and validate our approach in simulated data before illustrating its applicability in a data set covering 107 European NUTS1-2 regions across 16 EU member states. For this dataset, we cannot reject the hypothesis of a homogeneous contribution of entrepreneurship to regional growth. That is, in this dataset, we find no evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity in the estimated slope coefficients for entrepreneurial activity across regions. There are several possible explanations for this negative result. The two we deem most likely are first that the NUTS1-2 level may not be disaggregated enough to coincide with the relevant boundaries of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We suspect our method would reveal significant differences across smaller geographical units, but the data unfortunately do not yet allow us to empirically test this hypothesis in a multi-country regional analysis. The second possible explanation is that the growth rates from 2006 to 2014 coincided with the global financial and the European crisis, and during this time, the effect of entrepreneurship on (long-run average) growth overall has been obscured. Our simulations also suggested a third reason. If measurement error is large (in the order of 33 or 0.015% point annual GDP-growth), the effects may also have been obscured. © 2017, The Author(s).

In its most abstract sense, an ecosystem is a biotic community, encompassing its physical environment, and all the interactions possible in the complex of living and nonliving components. Economics has always been about systems that explain differential output and outcomes. However, economics has generally ignored the role of entrepreneurship in economic systems, just as entrepreneurship studies have largely overlooked the role of systems in explaining the prevalence and performance of entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach has the promise to correct these shortcomings. Its two dominant lineages are the regional development literature and the strategy literature. Both lineages share common roots in ecological systems thinking, providing fresh insights into the interdependence of actors in a particular community to create new value. But studies of both regional development and strategic management have largely ignored the role of entrepreneurs in new value creation. In this paper, we will outline contributions to the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach and conclude with a promising new line of research to our understanding of the emergence, growth, and context of start-ups that have achieved great impact by developing new platforms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

During the past few decades, the configurations of new knowledge-intensive environments have required fertile settings for innovative and entrepreneurial activities. In these environments, Triple Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts where those agents are transforming their roles in the development and strengthening of national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. As a consequence, the phenomenon of entrepreneurial innovations emerged from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises, universities and government on their innovation performance (e.g., access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e.g., distinction of enterprises that develop entrepreneurial innovations or traditional innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section dataset of 19,188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006 to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of enterprises-university-government linkages on entrepreneurial innovations from diverse perspectives and research fields (e.g., open innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Scientific and policy attention for natural capital and ecosystem services have grown fast during the last decade. As a result, awareness on the value of the stock of natural capital and the flow of ecosystem services it provides increased. Decision-makers from governments, business and nature organisations nowadays have much better insights into the opportunities its sustainable use provides, for themselves and for society. Yet, translating lessons from natural capital research to policy remains complex. In this paper, on the basis of the results of the two-year Natural Capital Netherlands programme, it is elaborated how, in practice, governments, businesses and nature organisations can include the value of natural capital in their decision-making processes. The planning and decision-making processes studied in this programme can be clustered into three domains: sustainable entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial nature management and area development. For each domain of decision-making, the approach to be followed differs somewhat and different policies should be developed to reach the situation in which it is mainstream to include the value of natural capital in decision-making. Moreover, it is shown that incorporating natural capital leads to innovation, with new market opportunities, new nature development and new collaborations between various parties as a result. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study explores the institutional factors which influence the impact of education in building academic entrepreneurship in higher educational institutes of Uttarakhand state, India. In order to understand the institutional barriers, the author interviewed 68 senior-level educationists, who were working in the capacity of Director General, Professor, Head, or Director in three different universities or their affiliated institutions. Based on the qualitative data obtained from interviews, we identified five major and four minor factors which were influencing the impact of education in building academic entrepreneurship in the state. The major barriers identified were–poor entrepreneurial ecosystem, poor entrepreneurial orientation, and inclination of universities and institutes to prepare students for jobs, inadequate content of the subject, need for training of entrepreneurship faculty, or specialized entrepreneurship faculty and ineffective teaching methodology. The results so obtained were further reviewed and validated on the basis of past research. The study also takes into account the institutional problems in developing academic entrepreneurship in other developing countries and compares the results. The study will help policy-makers, teachers, and educational institutions to recognize the possible shortfalls in the education system, which eventually result in poor academic entrepreneurship. Suggestions for improvements are included. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Innovation scholars have long recognized entrepreneurship is ‘imitative’, whereas the commercialization of novelty is ‘innovative’. Thus they are highly distinctive skill-sets. Entrepreneurship, first, involves optimizing market sentiment for pure profit sometimes to the point of catastrophe and even fraudulence in many markets. These include: payment protection insurance (PPI) to ‘flash crashes’, automotive emission ‘defeat devices’, corporate bribery settlements, social media ‘hacking’, ‘fake news’ and a litany of other infractions and catastrophes. Innovation, by contrast, is more explorative and team-reliant. Even if patenting betrays the hope for commercialization on markets, patented innovation frequently fails. Some academic innovators even profess a preference for prizes over profits. Second, this means that collective ‘bonding’ among entrepreneurs, in the form of claimed ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’, is often based on a single customer platform or as a supplier of a highly specialist type of ‘imitative’ service from identikit pizza chains to ‘me-too’ smartphone apps. Through the latter, fused with artificial intelligence some interactive machine-learning services have long-existed as ‘postsocial’ algorithms serving customers of, for example, investment banks in stock and currency markets. Finally, entrepreneurship is fundamentally competitive, individualistic and non-solidaristic, whereas ‘open innovation’ was born from the practices of ‘open science’ and the collegiate tradition of research. Accordingly, ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’ can display more closure than RIS set-ups. This special issue explores aspects of these ecosystem platforms and their implications for emergent forms of urban and regional evolution in the near and nearly present future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Green-city innovation uses industrial and entrepreneurial ecosystems that can reduce environmental and ecological risks and achieve sustainable urban development without degrading urban environments. In a city, entrepreneurship ecosystems include start-ups and supporting networks of coordinating entities which contribute to economies of scale; however, these systems may make a city’s green environment worse, by contributing to air or water pollution. Even though there is a widely held perception of an adverse relationship between urban economic performance and urban environmental conditions, green-city development involving clean industries can be a way to attract employees without affecting urban environments negatively. However, there is a dearth of empirical studies that examine how such a green-related innovative entrepreneurial system could become a growth engine of cities. This paper examines whether a greener city can contribute to the economic prosperity of the city. A two-stage econometrics approach is the method applied, using data from 2000 and 2005. This paper contributes to the field by distinguishing concerns about urban environments in green cities from concerns about economic performances related to innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Compared with the entrepreneurship education in western universities, the entrepreneurial education in domestic colleges and universities faces the shortcomings of external atmosphere, institutional environment, system design and ideological transformation. It can promote the ecosystem stability and healthy development by class guidance, top-level design, ideological transformation and system construction. Innovation culture is the root of entrepreneurship education, and innovation culture can completely change the education of entrepreneurship. The ecosystem of entrepreneurship education in universities requires top-level design and top-down reform and optimization. Therefore, it should integrate entrepreneurial education into the whole social education system, and from primary to university period infiltrating the pioneering spirit of entrepreneurship education, thus ensuring innovation and entrepreneurship education effectively become a way of life and carrier form of a free and comprehensive development for all students. To this end, this paper, takes Jiangsu province as example, describes the innovation culture based on the construction strategy of entrepreneurial education system in colleges and universities.

The process of technology commercialization from universities has changed dramatically in the last few years. Many universities are rallying to improve society by creating social impact and wealth in their regions through the commercialization of technology derived from the research enterprise. Academic entrepreneurship is becoming part of the strategic mission of many universities, and the breadth of stakeholders involved in the activity has expanded. The creation and maintenance of a transformational and progressive entrepreneurial ecosystem within the university environment is essential to foster, support, develop, and commercialize new technologies. We outline the issues related to this shift in university culture, and provide the results of our experiment in creating such an ecosystem across the University of Texas System academic campuses and health science centers.

Of late, technology entrepreneurship and ecosystem for technology based start-ups are attracting the attention of policy makers and empirical researchers alike, across the world. In India, Bangalore has been receiving increased global recognition as a tech start-up hub; as of now, Bangalore is considered to be the home for the largest number of tech start-ups in the country and third largest in the world. An important factor that contributed to this "status and recognition" of Bangalore is the emergence of a unique entrepreneurial ecosystem, which supports and promotes tech start-ups. Given this, it is important to understand how a favorable entrepreneurial ecosystem for tech start-ups emerged in Bangalore. What are its major components? What role do these components play in different stages of the life cycle of tech start-ups in Bangalore? How mature is the ecosystem of Bangalore to support the emergence, sustenance and growth of tech start-ups to nurture them? What are the key lessons that can be derived out of the Bangalore tech hub experience? This article is an attempt to shed light on these issues. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

This Management of Organization Review (MOR) special issue aims to explore the key features of the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem in India. There is recent evidence that innovation and entrepreneurship dynamics in transforming economies differ from like processes in advanced market economies in significant ways (e.g., Maimone, Mudambi, Navarra, & Baglieri, 2016). Therefore, applying the dominant theoretical lens developed to study innovation and entrepreneurship in advanced market economies may be inappropriate. For instance, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) surveys clearly demonstrate the composition of total entrepreneurial activity (TEA) for advanced and transforming economies is substantially different, with a significantly higher level of ŉeed-based’ entrepreneurship in the latter. Hence the typical advanced economy transition from wage employment to a larger share for entrepreneurship may be reversed in transforming economies. Transforming economies also witness a significant role of the transnational diaspora in their entrepreneurial and innovation processes (Riddle, Hrivnak, & Nielsen, 2010). Further, at the level of corporate entrepreneurship, London and Hart (2004) argue that results of studies of subsidiary entrepreneurship undertaken in advanced market economies may not generalize to transforming market economies. In summary, a fundamental question is whether entrepreneurship and innovation in transforming economies are diverging from the norms of advanced economies as these countries get wealthier and develop entirely new trajectories (Hill & Mudambi, 2010). © 2017 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.

Much of the literature on gender differences in entrepreneurship focuses on entrepreneurial propensity and access to resources. This study takes a step further to explore gender differences in the type of new ventures pursued. Specifically, we investigate whether there is a gender difference in the pursuit of innovative vs. imitative new ventures. Additionally, we examine whether perceptions of the entrepreneur's environment influence the pursuit of innovative new ventures for female vs. male entrepreneurs. Utilizing PSED data, we find there is no significant difference between genders in the pursuit of innovative new ventures. However, entrepreneurial munificence (i.e., having friends who have started their own business and perceived support of financial institutions) matters for female-led businesses in their pursuit of innovative new ventures. These findings have major implications for building effective entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Institutions are often regarded as static and unchanging, portrayed as constraints on innovation, entrepreneurship, and regional economic change. We propose an alternative perspective in order to understand how entrepreneurs experience and engage with institutions in ways that shape and help advance their collective interests. Motivated by our own research on regional entrepreneurial development, we theorize institutions as lived and interpreted experiences. We present institutional change as a creative and experimental response to emergent or competing logics. This conception of institutions has implications for how we theorize about economic transformation, recognizing that processes of institutional change are set in motion by endogenous attempts by economic actors to make sense of and act upon contradictory aspects of their varied institutional lives. © 2017 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

With a view to enhancing the entrepreneurial activity of universities, the authors explore the concepts and features of the ‘experimental lab’, presenting it as an effective means of supporting entrepreneurial training programmes and helping students to turn ideas into actual start-ups. In this context, the term experimental lab refers to a network of entrepreneurial individuals from universities, research laboratories, the financial sector and industry who become part of an innovative ecosystem to sustain entrepreneurship. To evaluate the educational effectiveness of an experimental lab, the authors developed a virtual platform (ExperimentaLab) and simulated its everyday dynamics through role play. Data analysis revealed that ExperimentaLab could effectively process an idea and make it potentially ready for the market and investors: It is thus found to be a valid training tool for the entrepreneurial university. Based on the simulation results, the authors propose a framework for further investigation of the technique. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

Purpose - The formation of entrepreneurial ecosystems is recognized as an activity that can produce economic development and community revitalization. Social entrepreneurship is also an activity that is receiving growing attention because of its potential for addressing social and economic problems. However, while scholars have focused on how the participants in entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as investors and support organizations, influence ecosystem functioning, it is not clear what role social entrepreneurs can play in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Nor is it known how the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which social entrepreneurs are located can influence the founding and operation of their ventures. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this conceptual paper, theory is proposed to explain the interrelationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems and social entrepreneurship. Findings - It is theorized that entrepreneurial ecosystems will influence the operations and effectiveness of social entrepreneurs through mechanisms such as the ecosystem's diversity of resource providers, support infrastructure, entrepreneurial culture, and learning opportunities. In turn, social entrepreneurs can shape the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which they are situated by influencing the heterogeneity of ecosystem participants, garnering attention for the ecosystem, and increasing its attractiveness to stakeholders. Originality/value - Scholars examining entrepreneurial ecosystems have not studied the role of an increasingly important market actor: The social entrepreneur. At the same time, work on social entrepreneurship has not emphasized the community of social relations and cultural milieu in which social entrepreneurs found their ventures. The theory developed addresses both of these omissions and has important implications for practitioners focused on spurring entrepreneurial ecosystems and social entrepreneurship. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

With the rise of digital economy era and the global upsurge of entrepreneurship, the research of entrepreneurial ecosystem has attracted many scholars' in research participation. By the literature review, this paper tries to disclosure the theories and practice of entrepreneurship ecosystem, the connotation of each research orientation as well as to discuss the similarities and differences with the traditional regional economic theoryandtheresearchofentrepreneurshipin the past.This paper argues that vigorous development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem is driven by the technological change with the new institutions of the digital economy, and the rising awareness of economic risk and uncertainty. As a result, both directly and indirectly, entrepreneurs have more opportunities and supportive resourcesin comparison with the past, which in turn led to the rise of the theoretical research. By the comprehensive review of the literaturesby scholars in the field, there are three major research perspectivesinitially divided by the author: social network, institutional environment and the quantitative model. Each of them focuses on the needs of different in the phases of entrepreneurial ecosystem development, spatial scale and the application in practice. In summary, combining with the previous viewpoints by other scholars, this paper further proposes the research gaps and the potential development issues, including that the evolutionary perspective, urban challenge, collective action, thecollaborationintrans-regions which can serve as potential agenda for future researcher.

Purpose: Entrepreneurial ecosystems are receiving growing attention from scholars, practitioners and policy-makers in both developed and developing countries. Studies of this phenomenon have focused almost exclusively on ecosystems in large, urbanized regions and metropolitan areas, located primarily in developed economies. However, the prevalence of small cities across the globe and the increasing acknowledgment that entrepreneurship in small towns is a key determinant of their economic development and rejuvenation suggests that entrepreneurial ecosystems research would benefit from a broader lens of inquiry. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework for studying entrepreneurial ecosystems in small towns. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper introduces the concept of small town entrepreneurial ecosystems (STEEs), draws from a wide-ranging set of disciplines to delineate the ways in which small town ecosystems are similar to and different than their larger counterparts and theorizes about several strategies STEEs use to overcome their limitations. Findings: It is theorized that entrepreneurship in small cities is best conceptualized as the outcome of an ecosystem, which means that although small towns may not have some of the same key components as entrepreneurial ecosystems in large urban centers, other elements of the ecosystem may be able to bolster these deficiencies. It also suggests that those attempting to create or develop small town ecosystems may need to be entrepreneurial in the way they attract, view and utilize resources. Finally, it is theorized that small cities may be able to engage in several strategies to overcome their limitations and create vibrant entrepreneurial communities. Originality/value: The theory developed produces implications for scholars focused on entrepreneurial ecosystems, economic development and emerging economies and suggests practical implications for policy-makers and development organizations seeking to improve the economic landscape of small cities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The creation of start-ups using knowledge provided by universities has been identified as an important source of knowledge spillover and regional economic development. Entrepreneurship ecosystems in education have become the most important and efficient mechanism of business community engagement and knowledge transfer within university-industry-government framework creating value to society and regional economy. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes in-depth synthesis of eclectic literature on entrepreneurship ecosystems and knowledge spillover of entrepreneurship, examining the critical success factors and enablers of entrepreneurship ecosystems in education. Findings: This study proposes entrepreneurship education ecosystems as an alternative unit of analysis when it comes to considering the role of university-industry-government collaboration in knowledge commercialization. The authors recommend key entrepreneurship education ecosystem enablers for knowledge commercialization and engagement with entrepreneurial communities. Originality/value: The authors propose a framework for the creation of an entrepreneurship education ecosystem as a unit of analysis when considering the role of university-industry-government collaboration. It requires different approaches to teaching, research and business outreach, some of which have not yet been discovered or yet need to be created. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores the potential of social franchising to contribute to the development of the rural entrepreneurial ecosystem in contexts of market and governance failure in least developed countries. Social franchising is a social enterprise business model that provides market coordination and support systems to rural enterprises so they can achieve social objectives in a financially sustainable way. The case of Krishi Utsho—a network of 112 agricultural input shops in Bangladesh—illustrates how social franchising can address market and government coordination failures in the entrepreneurial ecosystem to benefit both rural entrepreneurs and their client smallholder farming families who earn under US$1 per day. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

Ecosystem services have been under intensive research and policy interest during the past two decades, resulting in advanced theoretical understanding and a variety of innovative policies. However, as economic approaches to ecosystem services are gaining foothold, co-creation of ecosystem services through entrepreneurial activity has been almost totally neglected in scientific discourse. By focusing on recent developments in the forests of Finland and Peru, we show how forest ecosystem service entrepreneurs are introducing new ecosystem service-related livelihood initiatives, business models and economic mechanisms. Scientists and policy-makers are showing a growing interest in how these bottom-up initiatives actually happen and what it takes to create new socioecological opportunities. The new discourse is critical toward the habit of mind to see a wide ontological and epistemological gap between the use and protection of ecosystems as well as between the abstracted practices of many ecosystem service approaches and particular forest use practices. © 2017 BioOne.

The subject of this article is the entrepreneurial activity of the population residing in the post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and its goal is to identify different types of ecosystems of entrepreneurship in these countries by means of analyzing entrepreneurial activity in various countries/groups of countries considered in the context of their societal and economic development. Empirically this article is based upon data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). On the basis of an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches in the relevant literature to the taxonomy of business ecosystems, using a set of key country-level indicators of the GEM for 2011, this article proposes a taxonomy for entrepreneurship ecosystems based on two ≤axes≥ the quality of entrepreneurial activity (high, average, below average) and the state of the entrepreneurial framework conditions in the respective countries (favorable, average, below average). The result is a clustering of CEE countries' entrepreneurship ecosystems, where the worst cluster consists solely of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the best contains the Czech Republic. Russia belongs to a cluster with mid-level indicators along both axes. The results might be used to implement a more focused policy promoting entrepreneurship and support for small businesses, which must move away from generalized schemes towards concrete policy concepts taking into account the resources and limitations of each of the selected types of entrepreneurship ecosystems.

The interest in education for entrepreneurship in primary and secondary schools constantly rises and it arouses a need to examine its impact on certain entrepreneurial characteristics. Not much research focusing on this topic has been conducted as yet. Research usually shows its positive impact on the intention to do business. In this study, we examined the mutual relation of five variables: pupils’ entrepreneurial spirit, pupils’ attitude to entrepreneurship, the school education focus on entrepreneurship, teachers’ influence and the influence of their relatives-entrepreneurs. To collect data, we used ASTEE questionnaire. The researched sample consisted of 268 pupils from primary and secondary schools in the Czech Republic. Only medium or small correlation values were found between the researched variables, which means that the formation of pupils’ entrepreneurial spirit and attitude to entrepreneurship is not principally influenced by the learning content about entrepreneurship and by teachers. The findings can support the opinion that education for entrepreneurship and preparation for entrepreneurship is more effective in a thought-out entrepreneurial ecosystem. © Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek Toruń 2017.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems have emerged as a popular concept to explain the persistence of high-growth entrepreneurship within regions. However, as a theoretical concept ecosystems remain underdeveloped, making it difficult to understand their structure and influence on the entrepreneurship process. The article argues that ecosystems are composed of 10 cultural, social, and material attributes that provide benefits and resources to entrepreneurs and that the relationships between these attributes reproduce the ecosystem. This model is illustrated with case studies of Waterloo, Ontario, and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The cases demonstrate the variety of different configurations that ecosystems can take. © 2015 Baylor University

We critically examine how an entrepreneurial ecosystem is structured using an exploratory and bottom-up approach. Past studies in this area have discussed the presence of elements in the system or captured the ecosystem as holistically as possible by extending to social, cultural, and institutional dimension. However, we find that such aggregated conceptualizations gave limited understanding to how different elements are connected and constitute the system. Here, we apply a social network approach by analyzing the connections of the ecosystem at multiple layers: (1) among entrepreneurs, (2) among support organizations, and (3) between and among entrepreneurs and key support organizations. Through a series of interviews with entrepreneurs and support organizations in St. Louis, we find that the ways in which support organizations in this region interacted with each other and with entrepreneurs, including explicit cross-organizational collaboration and strategic structuring of resources, significantly impacted the way that entrepreneurs interacted with one another and with organizations, thus deepening our understanding of these connections and identifying intervening points within the ecosystem. © 2017 by De Gruyter.

The relevant literature recognises Schumpeterian and Kirznerian entrepreneurship as mechanisms that can impact economic growth. This article seeks to explore the effects of these two types of entrepreneurship on economic growth across the three GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) economic ecosystems (factor-driven economy, efficiency-driven economy, innovation-driven economy). Using different databases, we applied unbalanced panel data for 43 countries (2009–2013). By estimating the econometric models, we were able to calculate the effects of these two types of entrepreneurship on economic growth in the three different types of economy. In terms of the overall model for GEM economies, neither Schumpeterian nor Kirznerian entrepreneurship return any statistically significant effects on the Global Competitiveness Index or on GDP growth. However, the Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity variable generates a positive effect on the Global Competitiveness Index. The results presented in this paper provide insights into entrepreneurship and the GEM entrepreneurial economic ecosystems. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: Female entrepreneurship is a growing segment in the context of developing countries and has the potential to become a driving force for economic development. However, research suggests that females are less inclined toward entrepreneurship when compared to their male counterparts. This fact is related to a complex mix of causes such as the belief that entrepreneurship is a male domain, certain conditions within the economic and social environment and a general lack of confidence with regards to succeeding in such activities. Barriers to female entrepreneurship are prevalent in the patriarchal Arab world. The purpose of this paper is to measure the perceptions of female Jordanian business students with regards to the socio-cultural barriers to entrepreneurship. It also looks at the conduciveness of the education they are receiving in terms of new venture creation. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 254 female business students from two universities in Jordan was asked to evaluate various factors within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, including the business education they are currently receiving. A factor analysis has been performed to show which relevant elements may prevent young women from engaging with entrepreneurial activities. A comparison of perceptions about the educational system has also been presented to understand how a supportive educational environment may affect the previous analysis. Findings: The results indicated that a strong supportive education system to some extent may reduce the perception of potential barriers for entrepreneurship but the overall impact can be limited. Conversely, an educational system lacking a supportive environment and concrete initiatives can deeply affect and worsen the fears of engaging in entrepreneurship amongst female students. Originality/value: The role of women in the Arab world is quite marked and the reluctance of women to take a more decisive engagement in entrepreneurship may be reinforced by conservative, societal traditions. A supportive education system has the potential to act as a catalyst to encourage active female participation in the entrepreneurial domain, thus helping to spur economic development in the region. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Using an embeddedness perspective, a model and hypotheses are developed concerning the impact of the university entrepreneurial context on student start-up activity. Results based on analysis of the GUESSS database from 25 countries demonstrate that students' involvement in entrepreneurshiprelated curricular programs and co-curricular activities at university is positively related, and financial support from university is negatively related, to start-up activities undertaken by students. Prior business experience moderates the relationships between student involvement in university initiatives and start-up activities. The negative relationship between financial support and start-up activities is positively moderated by business experience. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a justified, legitimate and validated model on entrepreneurship education programmes (EEPs), by combining recent research and scholarship in leading edge entrepreneurship education (EE). Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of recent EE research and scholarship is followed by an empirical study to develop a model of EEPs. This was adopted by employing an emergent inquiry perspective incorporating participatory action research, using frame analysis and NVIVO to develop and analyse themes. Findings: This research identified three unique dimensions currently excluded from the theoretical and scholarship of EEPs, being distinct contextualisation, entrepreneurship ecosystems and recent content innovation in entrepreneurship. It also identified updates to current EEPs dimensions, such as online technologies, authentic alignment, causation, effectuation and bricolage, technology transfer the entrepreneurial university. Research limitations/implications: The discussion and model presented in this paper may be a starting point for future empirical studies on EEPs, by developing additional validation, justification and legitimisation. Practical implications: The study indicates that EEPs are integrative and dynamic, and always limited to contextual and contemporary inferences; providing guidance to developing such programmes. Hence, the applicability to update the original framework developed by Maritz and Brown (2013) as Part 2 of illuminating the black box of EEPs. Originality/value: This paper provides a first of its kind empirical study in the development of EEPs frameworks and models, deepening the theory, scholarship and development of such models. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This work is based on the fact that during the recent economic crisis the start-up company model has developed especially in certain European cities, which are characterized by a certain demographic dynamism coming mainly from migratory movements of qualified people. Taking this into account, this article has three objectives: the first, to identify the economic, demographic and institutional causes of the booming of this type of company. The second is to tackle the socio-demographic profile of start-up workers and, finally, to establish an explanatory relationship between the creator / start-up worker and the entrepreneurship activity. The methodology used for the design of this work is based on the combination of three approaches: the analysis of statistical data and specific legislation, obtained from sec ondary sources, the application of netnographic perspective, in an early stage, based on the analysis of online contents, which is the framework of exchange and the essence of the operation between the entrepreneurial ecosystem and finally, the analysis of reports through interviews to privileged informants. Regarding the analysis of statistical data, the most widely used source for address ing the subject of entrepreneurship is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). This document measures the entrepreneurial activity, the attitudes and the aspirations of individuals. Its greatest contribution lies in the diversity of variables presented in the reports and the possibility of comparing the situation between the different countries in the study (more than 100 since its origin). This paper has taken advantage of the 2015 report on Spain, which allows us to show the evolution and role of entrepreneurship between profiles and specific sectors of the labour market. In order to complement the statistical approach, data generated by the Centre for Sociological Research (CIS), in par ticular the barometer of October 2015 on attitudes towards entrepreneurship, have been used. A third source in the descriptive statistical analysis comes from different platforms of start-ups accelerators in Spain and Europe, mainly from Startupxplore. Two documents have been analysed regarding the regulations on entrepreneurship. At European level, the key document to draw up the idea of entrepreneurship in Europe 2020 is the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. Reigniting the entrepreneurial spirit in Europe (EAP), in which the main lines for the promotion of entrepreneurship are highlighted and at national level, Law 14/2013 of 27 September, supporting entrepreneurs and their interna tionalization. The analysis of the contents of both documents allows to establish similarities and differences towards the design of an explanatory framework, which contributes to the theoretical understanding and, ultimately, to better know the subject studied. As for the netnographic analysis, the main associations of Spanish start-ups with a major presence in the network have been located. This analysis allows us to build the different nodes of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We are working on the categorization of the information that these virtual platforms offer and on the comparison of variables that allow us to elaborate a classification related to profiles of founders and participants; way of working, objectives of the association, etc. Regarding the analysis of the reports, we are working on developing interview scripts and making contacts with experts and founders / start-up workers. The information obtained in the interviews conducted in the survey entitled "The third stage of the European migratory system. Young Spanish workers in Germany. Dynamics to gain access to the labour market and construction of migration networks", 12 represents the starting point of this article because the conclusions show the connection between the "mobile migration project" -among a profile of qualified young emigrants- and the labour destination towards the start-up. Based on this observation, we intend to analyse the culture of entrepreneurship and its relation with the evolution of the start-up model between the cities of Madrid and Berlin, which is the overall objective of the project, financed by Universidad Europea, where we are currently working. As first conclusions of the current survey, a series of ideas can be disclosed: - We can clearly outline the profile of the creators of start-ups (qualified young people with experience and technological skills), and the emerging consolidation of an "entrepre neurial ecosystem" in Spain. - We can foresee the hypothesis that the talent of entrepreneurs only flourishes, or flourishes in a more remarkable way, in cities or countries where effective policies are put together which allow, in most cases, to transform projects into realities taking into account the needs of the community and the demands of labour legislation in a globalised world. Finally, in recent times flexible work can create a "mobile identity" as a priority form not only to enter, but also to remain in the labour market. - The consolidation of this network of relations built within the framework of informational capitalism has given rise, in a global world, to the emergence of a new identity, an identity characterized by labour and vital nomadism that is being fitted into organizational modalities (start-ups, pendular work, etc.) and management (self-motivation, entrepreneurship, etc.) ac cording to the context (crisis or recession) and space (creative or traditional cities).

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to shed light on the increasing start-up competitions (SUCs) phenomenon; second, to provide an interpretive framework to understand whether the SUCs have the potential to be effective entrepreneurial learning environment; third, to analyse the different roles of public and private actors in organizing SUCs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a cross-section analysis of the Italian SUCs population. In total, 77 competitions are analysed on the basis of different criteria which should properly mirror their distinguishing structural features, helping understand the potential of SUCs as learning environments. Findings: The recent increase in the number of SUCs has been mainly fuelled by private actors. Moreover, Italian SUCs show some features that make them rich learning environments. Private and public actors play different roles, as confirmed by statistical tests performed. Privately organized SUCs follow mainly a market-oriented approach, while publicly organized ones are more education oriented. Research limitations/implications: The findings cannot be easily generalized mainly due to the peculiarities of the Italian context. Practical implications: Soft forms of regulation should be defined to strengthen those features which could potentially support the entrepreneurial learning processes. In this view, SUCs should be part of a start-up friendly ecosystem where actors (startuppers, incubators, venture capitalists) are effectively coordinated with each other. Originality/value: Despite the remarkable diffusion of SUCs, there are significant gaps in literature about this phenomenon. Given the lack of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of SUCs as effective entrepreneurial learning environments, the paper represents an important starting point. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an original six-phase model describing entrepreneurial learning in the transition of place-based enterprises toward a sustainable exploitation of natural common resources (commons). Design/methodology/approach: The six-phase model proposed by this study explains the learning processes involving place-based enterprises through two important existing theories: adaptive co-management and Lachmann’s evolutionary, embedded theory of entrepreneurship. The proposed model integrates these two theories on the basis of a longitudinal case study on the fishing enterprises in an Italian marine protected area (MPA). Findings: In the case study, the success factors identified by the adaptive co-management literature proved important in enabling an embedded entrepreneurial learning process consistent with Lachmann’s view. The case analysis allowed the authors to cluster these learning processes around six phases. Further, even if traditional fishing is not knowledge-intensive, this case shows the transition to a sustainable business model required intense efforts of educated institutional work and scientific research. Interestingly, the key learning processes were enabled by the emergence of a larger, networked social entity (a network form of organization) including the community of fishermen, the MPA management and a network of scientists studying the marine area ecosystem. Research limitations/implications: This study is explorative and relies on a single case study. Despite this limitation, it opens up new research paths in the fields of entrepreneurship, institutional work, network organizations and adaptive management of the commons. Originality/value: This study is strongly interdisciplinary; it proposes an original model based on a theoretical view that is highly innovative for organization and management studies; and addresses a relevant but overlooked issue with important societal implications. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: In today’s global economy, high in talent but low in growth, the capability and skills mismatch between the output of universities and the demands of business has escalated to a worrying extent for graduates. Increasingly, university students are considering alternatives to a lifetime of employment, including their own start-up, and becoming an entrepreneur. The literature indicates a significant disconnect between the role and value of education and healthy enterprising economies, with many less-educated economies growing faster than more knowledgeable ones. Moreover, theory concerning the entrepreneurial pipeline and entrepreneurial ecosystems is applied to graduate entrepreneurial intentions and aspirations. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Using a large-scale online quantitative survey, this study explores graduate “entrepreneurial intention” in the UK and France, taking into consideration personal, social and situational factors. The results point to a number of factors that contribute to entrepreneurial intention including social background, parental occupation, gender, subject of study and nationality. The study furthers the understanding of and contributes to the extant literature on graduate entrepreneurship. It provides an original insight into a topical and contemporary issue, raising a number of research questions for future study. Findings: For too long, students have been educated to be employees, not entrepreneurs. The study points strongly to the fact that today’s students have both willingness and intention to become entrepreneurs. However, the range of pedagogical and curriculum content does not correspond with the ambition of those who wish to develop entrepreneurial skills. There is an urgent need for directors of higher education and pedagogues to rethink their education offer in order to create a generation of entrepreneurs for tomorrow’s business world. The challenge will be to integrate two key considerations: how to create a business idea and how to make it happen practically and theoretically. Clearly, change in the education product will necessitate change in the HE business model. Research limitations/implications: The data set collected was extensive (c3500), with a focus on France and the UK. More business, engineering and technology students completed the survey than others. Further research is being undertaken to look at other countries (and continents) to test the value of extrapolation of findings. Initial results parallel those described in this paper. Practical implications: Some things can be taught, others need nurturing. Entrepreneurship involves a complex set of processes which engender individual development, and are highly personalised. Higher Education Enterprise and Teaching and Learning Strategies need to be cognisant of this, and to develop innovative and appropriate curricula, including assessment, which reflects the importance of the process as much as that of the destination. Social implications: The global economy, propelled by the push and pull of technology, is changing at a speed never before seen. This is having profound political, social and economic effects which necessitate fundamental change that we organise ourselves and our activities. Current models and modus operandi are proving increasingly unfit for purpose. Nurturing and encouraging agile mindsets, creativity, supporting the testing of new ideas and ways of doing things and adapting/adopting to innovation are all critical future employability factors. Our future prosperity and well-being will be dependent on creating new learning models. Originality/value: This work builds on an extensive literature review coupled with original primary research. The authors originate from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, and the result is a very challenging set of thoughts, comments and suggestions that are relevant to all higher education institutions, at policy, strategy and operational levels. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Women in entrepreneurship can have a significant impact on economic and social development globally and particularly in developing countries. But the challenges entrepreneurial women face are unique and multiple, pressing the need for research and policies to maximize impact. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the challenges women start-up founders face to secure funding in the technology industry. The tech industry was selected because it is a non-Traditional industry for women with high potential for role models to bridge an existing gap in information on women start-up founders to secure capital financing to attain business sustainability. It covers venture capital investors' role, Latin American cultural reasons, and gender. Design/methodology/approach -This study is based on an inductive, qualitative approach and in-depth interviews with 20 women entrepreneurs and start-up founders from Latin American countries who received support from the Chilean Government sponsored accelerator "Start-Up Chile." Findings -The analysis uncovered ten aspects that impact entrepreneurial women founders' access to capital in three categories: capital needs, networks, and individual characteristics. Originality/value -This study identifies factors that affect women entrepreneurs in raising capital and in facing the following challenges: first, working in a non-Traditional field for women as it is the technology industry, and second assuming a leadership role as start-up founders. The results offer recommendation with potential to drive public policies in Latin America, which may be scalable to other developing and also to developed countries where market systems prevail. The findings show that women entrepreneurs, but alsomen, seeking start-up financing and alternatives are a viable source of employment and economic sustainability to mitigate the effects of increasing levels of unemployment worldwide. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of university-level support practices and entrepreneurial behaviour of spin-offs from nine universities in Boston. We explore the prerequisite to venture in the university, the entrepreneurs' attitude throughout the first years of activity, and discuss differences in spin-offs' outcomes. The investigation explores 81 academic spin-offs active since 2013. We found that two alternative behaviours are suitable to provide the right support to academic spin-offs. In top-academic institutions the availability of services and incentives to facilitate patent rights ownership, university equities, and venture capital is more likely to be found, while in lower-ranked universities spin-offs mostly rely on incubators services to overcome capital limitations.

The Government of India has set up a new institution called Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Bank (MUDRA Bank) for development of micro units and refinance of Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) to encourage entrepreneurship in India & provide the funding to the non corporate small business sector. The present initiative is launched on 8 April 2015 and has completed the journey of 2 years and is expected to create the favourable entrepreneurship/startup ecosystem in India. The present study tries to evaluate the performance of this initiative in terms of state-wise, bank-wise performance and category wise disbursements and the extent to which the beneficiaries are reached. The study concludes that the launch of MUDRA and PMMY is the landmark initiative in the financial inclusion landscape for transforming India. This will create not only the favourable entrepreneurial ecosystem for businesses but will help uplift socioeconomic standards of the deprived section of the society by creating the multiplier effect in the economy.

This study aims to compare the similarities and differences between business enterprise incubation and social enterprise incubation, and propose a more inclusive incubation framework. To understand the selection of social enterprise incubation and the business support, a semi-structured interview was employed in this study. There were 9 interviewees, 4 of which were the managers of social enterprise incubation and the other 5 were social enterprise investors. MAXQDA10 is employed as data analysis tool. This study found that on the selection of social enterprise incubation, it is primarily "social mission" and "economic goal", followed by "customer oriented" and "resource oriented". Business support was seen as a continuum from "refusal" to "strong intervention". Based on the consensus of the double bottom line, "company" and "customization" may be used in incubation support. On the contribution to theory, this study proposes the trait of social enterprise incubation is mainly the balance of the double bottom line. On the contribution to practice, this study revises the incubation framework, and recommends that social enterprise incubators may set aside the mindset of business enterprise incubation and develop the potential social enterprise market. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insights on the relational dimension of a networked business incubator (NBI), by investigating the intermediary role of incubator management in fostering social and business ties linking tenants among each other, with the incubator management and external actors. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers a literature review on the NBIs and advances a comprehensive analytical framework of the networked incubation model. This framework is empirically illustrated through a case study research on a leading Italian private NBI, namely, H-Farm. The collection of primary data was conducted by means of face-to-face in-depth interviews and a survey. Data were processed through social network analysis (SNA) tools. Findings: The results highlight the co-presence and interaction of social and business ties, which build up a vital environment nurturing an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Community-based relationships and the intermediation of incubator management are crucial for supporting tenants in product and business development activities. Research limitations/implications: These results pave the way to further research, oriented to the conceptualization of a NBI as a (small) cluster. Moreover, the application of the SNA tools adopted invites further research on networked incubators, applying the same methodology in new directions. Originality/value: This paper adds to previous literature on NBIs by providing evidence of the intermediary role of incubator management in promoting and facilitating social and business relationships occurring among tenants, between tenants and the incubator management, as well as with external advisors, clients and suppliers. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Today, social entrepreneurship is considered as a growth driver for emerging countries. This phenomenon that combines economic utility and social efficiency has recently attracted considerable interest in the academic world as well as among public institutions. In Morocco, it is during the last decade we witnessed an infatuation toward this new type of entrepreneurship. Several actors are working today to promote the sector; however, there is a lack of research on their role in developing the ecosystem of the Moroccan social enterprise. Based on a qualitative study, this article aims to map the stakeholders of social entrepreneurship, their missions and their role in creating a favorable environment for the emergence of social entrepreneurs. The results are presented as an exploratory basis.

Although the importance of entrepreneurship is evident and interest continues to grow, high-growth ventures tend to be featured because they produce a significant amount of job and wealth creation in the United States. Some have argued that the focus of public policy should be on these ventures, while others argue for a more diverse approach to effective public policy and entrepreneurship. This article offers a ‘‘portfolio approach’’ to public policy that focuses on the types of entrepreneurial ventures that demonstrate the epitome of competition and provide the greatest societal value. The types of ventures may be classified in terms of size (microenterprise, small/lifestyle, medium size, and gazelle) and growth rate (low, managed, or fast growth). Each type has different needs and makes unique contributions to the economic vitality and value of society. © The Author(s) 2016.

This article qualitatively identifies and explains the barriers that foreign cleantech start-ups can encounter when attempting to enter the Chinese market, as well as the possible strategies that can help overcome these barriers. We base our analysis on interviews with Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs and facilitators. To structure the analysis of such barriers, we use the components of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. We then explain the barriers using institutional theory. We demonstrate that they are caused either by the regulations in China or by the difference between Chinese and Western logics. We further recommend that cleantech entrepreneurs come prepared to China, remain flexible, associate themselves with reputable partners and take advice from those familiar with business in China. Cultural–cognitive barriers might be overcome by integrating the communities of foreign and Chinese start-ups. Regulative barriers can be removed by the Chinese Government, but this conflicts with the logic of state control. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

How do we deal with environmental management issues at the local level? Traditionally, the approach proposed from an environmental management perspective has involved various kinds of “top-down” regulatory measures, such as defining a standard that must be satisfied or a tax on pollution. Conversely, there has been less focus on the analysis of local, bottom-up approaches, as for example the effectiveness of various ways of organizing a local environmental transition process. Our focus is on analyzing of under what conditions it is possible for a “green entrepreneur” (GE) to manage a transition from brown to green energy? Theoretically, we consider four entrepreneurial skills, at least two of which must be present for the GE to succeed. In the case of the Danish island of Samsø and its rapid introduction of renewable energy, three of these skills are found to be present: profits, communication, and trustworthiness. The GE, however, failed to activate the fourth skill concerning the ability to persuade local non-green actors regarding the value of the green component. Thus, a main result is that it is crucial to convince non-green locals about the profitability of local environmental management rather than its potentially green components. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Startup ecosystems have a positive impact on the creation of new businesses and the entire economy and accordingly receive attention from both academics and politicians. However, while entrepreneurial ecosystems reflect a high level of entrepreneurial activity, they differ significantly in terms of the proportion of female founders, which means some ecosystems do not fulfill their true potential. This study uses qualitative comparative analysis to explore the combinations of ecosystem characteristics explaining a high proportion of female founders in the 20 most successful startup ecosystems worldwide. The results suggest two different configurations explaining a high proportion of female founders and reveal which issues require attention on a metropolitan level and which issues might require national policy makers to become involved. These findings contribute to the ecosystem literature and link to the stream of female entrepreneurship. © 2016

We wonder the value proposition offered in these cooperations by identifying the resources and skills at stake. From a qualitative analysis based on semi structured interviews with actors of support in creation and crowdfunding platforms as well as on secondary data, our results show that these cooperations are determined by the willingness to improve their business model with the benefits of reinforced network effects. ©Lavoisier.

This paper focuses on how the evolving roles of a university and its Technology Transfer Office (TTO) are stimulating academic entrepreneurship in a non-mature entrepreneurial ecosystem. A more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem was built gradually by these actors through their progressive creation of innovation intermediaries and coordination among the local players involved in the creation of start-ups. We analyse how the university became a hub organisation. We use the case of the University of Strasbourg to show that the university contributed to the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem by acting as a boundary spanner and by building and orchestrating the network of the stakeholders in the local system of innovation. This ‘hub’ university became a leading regional organisation at the political level. The TTO played a central role in supporting academic entrepreneurship at the operational level based on its evolution from a revenue maximising model to a model that takes account of social and economic regional development. The progressive adoption of a more selective model of start-up creation requires good coordination among the local actors. Over time, the TTO’s boundary spanning function increased to encompass the development of operational network building and orchestrating functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Universities play a well-established role in regional economic growth, one contribution to which is academic entrepreneurship, the establishment and support of faculty and graduate student spinoff companies based on university research. A vibrant literature examines the general contributions of universities within regional innovation ecosystems while another strain of literature examines individual intermediaries, such as technology licensing offices and incubators, in support of the university’s economic development mission. Little research exists, however, that conceptualizes the structure and function of an entrepreneurial university ecosystem. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by examining the composition, contributions, and evolution of social networks among faculty and graduate student entrepreneurs and the role of knowledge intermediaries therein. While our investigation supports an emerging literature that finds academic entrepreneurs are typically limited by their own homophilous social networks, we also find that spinoff success relies upon academic and non-academic contacts who connect faculty and students to other social networks important to spinoff success. We investigate how by creating a taxonomy of social network evolution among spinoffs; the results show that the contributions of universities depend on the existence and interrelationship of loosely coordinated, heterogeneous knowledge intermediaries guided by a strong collective ethos to encourage and support academic entrepreneurship. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this paper and the special issue is to improve our understanding of the theoretical, empirical, managerial and political implications of emerging models of entrepreneurial universities in the new social and economic landscape. We accomplish this objective by examining the role of entrepreneurial universities as drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship activities. Our analysis starts with an overview by outlining an overarching framework. This allows us to highlight the contributions made in this special issue within the framework. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research and discuss implications for university managers, policy makers, and other academic agents involved in the development of entrepreneurial/innovation ecosystems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The concept of ecosystem has been largely used to indicate the network of complementary actors, resources and relationships required to succeed in knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial initiatives. The development of ecosystems has been mostly considered as a region and industry-independent issue. This paper discusses the relevance of fostering the creation of more entrepreneur-centric ecosystems ("EGO-Systems") to support an effective idea-to-venture process. A model is presented which includes five components (entrepreneurial actor, stakeholders, project, roadmap, flows) and it is addressed to support technology entrepreneurship initiatives through an innovative approach which is glocal, project-specific and dynamic. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.

High-growth entrepreneurial ventures can be the engine of economic growth, but need the support of a diverse and well-integrated entrepreneurial ecosystem in order to succeed. Sufficient resources from multiple stakeholders in the local environment are necessary in order to maintain and grow these ventures. The presence of peripheral stakeholders such as small non-scalable businesses are proposed as critical to the success of entrepreneurial activity. Therefore, peripheral stakeholder needs must be considered. Suggestions are made for engagement of all entities in a conversation about how to identify and nurture a fertile ground for development and growth. To start, all the various resource providers who depend on entrepreneurial activity should identify niche players who may have chosen to stay small. © 2016 Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship.

Research summary: Firms introducing disruptive innovations into multisided ecosystems confront the disruptor's dilemma: gaining the support of the very incumbents they disrupt. Through a longitudinal study of TiVo, a company that pioneered the Digital Video Recorder, we examine how these firms may address this dilemma. Our analysis reveals how TiVo navigated coopetitive tensions by continually adjusting its strategy, its technology platform, and its relational positioning within the evolving U.S. television industry ecosystem. We theorize how (1) disruption may affect not just specific incumbents, but also the entire ecosystem; (2) coopetition is not just dyadic, but also multilateral and intertemporal, and (3) strategy is both a deliberative and emergent process involving continual adjustments, as the disruptor attempts to balance coopetitive tensions over time. Managerial summary: New entrants confront a dilemma when they introduce a disruptive innovation into an existing business ecosystem, viz., how can they gain the support of the incumbents that their innovation disrupts? Confronting this “disruptor's dilemma”, the disruptor must consider several issues: How might it pitch its innovation to attract end customers and yet reduce the threat of disruption perceived by ecosystem incumbents? How can the innovation be modified to fit into legacy systems while transforming them? Based on an in-depth analysis of TiVo and its entrepreneurial journey, we explore the strategies disruptors can deploy to address these issues. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The study explores whether the university origin of a technology-based firm conditions its growth in terms of both sales and employment. The small firm size of a significant percentage of technology-based university spin-offs (T-USOs) puts into question the policies geared towards promoting university entrepreneurship. A sample of 340 Spanish technology-based firms (219 T-USOs and 121 T-non-USOs) was constructed by using the non-parametric technique of propensity score matching and the data refer to the period 2001–2010. Applying panel data methodology, we find that the T-USOs outperform the T-non-USOs. Therefore, the need for support of university-based entrepreneurship by governments and by the universities is justified, because in this way, they are promoting economic growth and social development. By launching T-USOs, universities not only contribute to the economic growth but also to the internationalisation of the economy, as T-USOs show a more international orientation. In addition, the results lead us to emphasise the need to customise university policies aimed at promoting the growth of T-USOs. Given that the study is focused on a ‘moderate innovator’ country, the conclusions and proposals of this paper may be extrapolated to other countries with similar innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems, namely the Mediterranean and Latin American countries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Prior research highlights the importance of co-investments among foreign and domestic investors in an emerging VC market. Yet, the question of how domestic and foreign VC syndicate partners select each other for their initial co-investment remains an open one. The question is important because uncertainty in emerging markets exposes participants to risks associated with higher levels of agency, problems of adverse selection, and potential opportunism. Building on agency theory, we hypothesize and test the risk mitigating effects of economic and social signals on the choice of initial co-investment ties among domestic and foreign VCs in an emerging market. Our work has implications for international management research, the practice of international VC investing, and public policy that tries to stimulate venture driven ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This article examines three forms of tourism gentrification within the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces UNESCO World Heritage Site in Yunnan, China. The Indigenous Hani and Yi communities who populate this remote mountainous area possess distinct cultural practices that have supported the rice terrace ecosystem for centuries. This article uses interviews and non-participant observation conducted with inhabitants and newcomers to analyse the gentrification within the site. We argue that Indigenous cultural practices, and consequently rice cultivation in the area, are threatened by gentrifier-led and state-led gentrification, combined with high levels of outward migration of Indigenous persons. This poses a significant threat to the sustainability of tourism there, to the survival of the traditions and culture of the Indigenous inhabitants and could compromise the site's World Heritage Status. Some Indigenous people are, however, improving their socio-economic standing – and becoming “middle-class” or “gentry” – particularly through adopting entrepreneurial strategies gleaned from their encounters with outside-gentrifiers and tourists. This article proposes the concept of “self-gentrification” as a way to describe individuals who seek to improve themselves and their own communities, while threatened by gentrification, and offers ways to promote that concept to help conserve both heritage landscapes and Indigenous ways of life. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems (EE) consist of interacting components, which foster new firm formation and associated regional entrepreneurial activities. Current work on EE, however, focuses on documenting the presence of system components, which means there is little understanding of interdependencies between EE components and their evolutionary dynamics. To address these issues, the objective of the present study is to develop an evolutionary framework of EE development that integrates important components from prior work and describes how critical elements of an entrepreneurial system interact and evolve over time. The value of this framework in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of EE will be demonstrated by profiling the EE of Phoenix, Arizona. The evolutionary perspective developed is valuable because it provides a sense of how history, culture and the institutional setting impact EE. It also provides stakeholders with action points to help maintain or propel an EE to the next level. This is a distinct improvement over static approaches that provide a list of EE ingredients with no sense of their relative importance over time. The proposed framework may also be used in a comparative context to compare and contrast the evolutionary trajectory of EE to better understand why particular places remain trapped in a specific phase of growth or continue to evolve over time. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.

In the Higher School of Agronomic and Forestry Engineering of the University of Cordoba, a collective project conceived as an ‘ecosystem to support and accompany entrepreneurs’ has been proposed. The approach aims to spread and consolidate the entrepreneurial spirit and to respond to the demands of possible stakeholders involved in the whole process of training, as well as the subsequent integration of graduates into the labour market. Putting into practice this initiative, which involves multiple actors, is a complex and difficult task. For this reason, prior to its implementation, the authors considered it necessary to listen to main stakeholders’ opinions and evaluate their degree of commitment and the requirements they consider important for the viability and sustainability of the initiative. This paper focuses on the faculty’s opinions, gathered by means of a survey conducted with the entire faculty (N = 128, response rate = 45%) and semi-structured interviews held with 20 members of the School board. The results suggest that there is a general consensus on the suitability of this collective project and that there is a core of teachers willing to get involved. Evidently, guidelines need to be produced to facilitate taking on such tasks. However, the main drawbacks are related with the conflict between formal requirements of professor professional profile and the steps needed to establish the ecosystem. © 2015 SEFI.

The Natural Environment White Paper represents the most important conservation policy shift in the United Kingdom (UK) in twenty years. It formalises the ecosystem approach within national policy objectives and emphasises the economic value of ecosystem services. By analysing the use of various evidence sources, the involvement of science entrepreneurs, and the development of policy narratives, our goal was to understand factors that influenced adoption of an ecosystem service framework in the UK. We interviewed 48 policy actors and found that centrally-sponsored synthesis reports with entrepreneurial authors provided the most influential expert-based knowledge in the development of the White Paper. More recently published reports had greater influence, yet the window of opportunity for scientific evidence having policy impact was greater in the problem-setting stages of policy development. The interaction between teams preparing syntheses and expert entrepreneurs helped influence the construction of strategic policy narratives. Those narratives increased the impact of scientific evidence by communicating and framing key policy-salient messages, and brokering between broad ecosystem-based and environmental economics narratives. The combination of ecological and economics evidence was particularly salient in the UK case due to the context of continued biodiversity loss and the acceptability of valuation narratives within central government. Our findings suggest that evidence impact varies at different stages of the policy process, and that this is driven by the interplay of contextual factors like policy timing, personal influence, and the competition between different sets of actors and narratives. © 2016.

Knowledge acquisition and development of capabilities constitutes a key perspective in studies regarding the formation of new ventures. When examining entrepreneurship ecosystems, we find that the composition of a region influences the new knowledge acquired by the venture. The main aim of this study is to examine the influence of the new venture, the entrepreneur’s social capital, and the firm performance on the new venture’s knowledge acquisition activities. In particular, the study examines how the institutional context of a region influences new ventures’ knowledge acquisition actions during its growth, and in turn the level of sustained entrepreneurial activity within the region. The paper focuses on the formation of alliances by new ventures, one particular form of knowledge acquisition process that has been established as critical to new venture success in the high technology sector. The mechanisms for acquiring and transforming knowledge have the greatest impact on new venture formation, and in this context, the concepts of strategic knowledge arbitrage and strategic knowledge serendipity (SKARSE™) are validated through an agent-based simulation model. The main results focus on the effects of interactions between entrepreneurs and institutions in the process of new venture formation from a knowledge creation, dissemination, and absorption perspective. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Innovation manifests itself in myriad forms in developing communities. A better understanding of the meaning and rationale for innovation, as perceived by the rapidly-growing youth population in developing countries, is pivotal to the design of practical and sustainable technology innovations and entrepreneurial ecosystems. This article presents the findings of interviews conducted with 271 youth across the rural, semi-urban, and urban areas of Kenya, Tanzania, India and Nicaragua. These provisional narratives explain how the next generation perceives innovation, and illustrates how cultural mechanisms and communal context bias innovative solutions for individual or community needs. The dynamic interdependence between innovation and the socio-cultural context is brought to life by juxtaposing narratives of respondents from Kenya and Tanzania, neighboring countries with starkly different histories. Different perceptions of what constitutes innovation is critical as it varies from location to location and impacts the likelihood of success of different technologies and innovations. Such similarities and differences in the major themes of innovations, driving factors, and rationales can inform and inspire innovators seeking to meld western and indigenous innovation frameworks to foster self-determined improvement of lives and livelihoods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Government sponsorship of entrepreneurship has become a popular policy tool in the last 15 years. Despite this popularity, past academic studies have largely focused on firm-level survival rates and treated the effects of government sponsorship in isolation, which fails to capture the full effect of the sponsorship. That is, the objectives of the public sector include enhancing the macro-level entrepreneurial environment of the region as well as the success of individual firms. We expand research in this area through a case study in St. Louis, Missouri. We focus on the Arch Grants, a public–private coalition that provides $50,000 to 20 winners through their annual competition. Based on interviews of 46 recipient firms and 15 support organizations, we first demonstrate how government sponsorship can create a cohort of entrepreneurs who are able to learn from each other about business strategy, local mentors and other resources. Second, we uncover the process through which sponsorship can facilitate coordination among local entrepreneurship support organizations. Thus, we conclude that the evaluation of government sponsorship should go beyond the traditional firm-level performance measurement and consider the integration and enhancement of the local entrepreneurship ecosystem. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper proposes an analytical framework for understanding the inhibiting factors in scaling the social impact of social entrepreneurial organizations (SEOs). The framework distinguishes the relevant actors on different levels (leaders, organization, ecosystem) and suggests (pre)conditions from their perspectives (willingness, ability, admission) that are crucial for scaling processes. It further argues that those (pre)conditions are determined by three social forces (cognitive frames, social networks, and institutions) as proposed by Beckert (2010) in his social grid model. The framework is applied and tested by empirically analysing current inhibiting factors for scaling SEOs' impact in Germany, a state with a highly regulated social welfare field. The empirical analysis is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 German SEOs, being mainly young and small pioneer organizations. It identifies a wide range of inhibiting factors, showing that the German welfare system imposes specific barriers for scaling innovative ideas of smaller SEOs. The findings are discussed against previous research conducted in English-speaking institutional contexts and set out implications and suggestions for further research. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) program at The Pennsylvania State University, engages students and faculty in the rigorous research, design, field-testing, and launch of technology-based social enterprises. HESE ventures range from low-cost greenhouses and solar food dryers to telemedicine systems and low-cost biomedical devices HESE ventures encompass two overlapping sectors: food value chains (FVCs) and global health. A flagship HESE venture related to FVCs involves affordable greenhouses (AGs). There are five critical aspects of HESE's educational and entrepreneurial ecosystem that distinguish it from other community-engaged programs. These include highly mult-disciplinary student and faculty teams, emphasis on sustainable and scalable solutions, a market-centric implementation approach, integration of scholarly research and publication, and focus on integration.

Purpose – Maintaining cooperation and avoiding opportunism is essential for a healthy venture capitalist (VC) – entrepreneur relationship. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of control and trust for developing a cooperative VC-entrepreneur relationship in an agency environment in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach – The study adopts a multiple case study approach to investigate ten VC-entrepreneur dyads. It uses data collected from both primary and secondary sources. Content analysis was used as the data treatment technique. Findings – The empirical evidence indicates that VC-entrepreneur relationships emerging in the early stages suffer from low agency risks and use more of relational mechanisms to curb opportunism and develop cooperation while relationships at an advanced stage suffer from higher agency risks and employ more of control mechanisms to address it. Practical implications – The findings can be utilized to enhance cooperation in VC-entrepreneur relationship by identifying the appropriate context to apply relational or control mechanisms, which would eventually lead to better performance of the venture. Originality/value – This distinction results in the development of a theoretical model which shows how the dual governance mechanisms of control and trust interact with one another to affect confidence in partner cooperation as an entrepreneurial venture raises multiple rounds of venture capital across various stages. The data collected from Indian VC-entrepreneur dyads offers a rich description of the relationship dynamics across the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in the Malaysian economy and are considered as the backbone of industrial development in the country. However, Malaysian SMEs' value added is very much lower than that of large-scale enterprises. The low productivity of physical inputs or factors efficiency may be attributed to the low level of value added. A first step to stimulating entrepreneurship is mapping and measuring the existing entrepreneurial ecosystem. This analysis allows for diagnosis of potential challenges and opportunities that can be addressed through specific interventions. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to explore what and how entrepreneurial ecosystem among SMEs in Malaysia contributes to the development particularly on wealth creation, employment and poverty eradication. Based on previous study six main entrepreneurial ecosystem variables will be explored (the government policy, finance, culture, support, markets and human capital) in relation to their impact on business performance of Malaysian SMEs. This conceptual paper is expected to contribute a theoretical development/model of the ecosystem of SMEs in Malaysia and to justify the need for the enhancement of SMEs entrepreneurship policy. The second phase of this research is expected to provide further feedback to enhance SMEs and entrepreneurship policy and to give some suggestions for SMEs in enhancing their business performance. Finally, it is hoped that this study can produce a segment in a more inclusive global picture of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of SMEs in Malaysia. © Medwell Journals, 2016.

The entrepreneurship required for a creative economy is one that promotes job creation through the creativity of CEOs who have entrepreneurial spirit as well as excellent knowledge and technology. This entrepreneurship plays a critical role in the construction of a venture business ecosystem. Meanwhile, big data, until now, have consisted only of numbers and texts that are specified and standardized by certain structured rules. Nowadays, however, big data analysis methods are being developed to gain information and business opportunities from new aspects through the use of nonstandard data. The big data technology is becoming a core element in the new digital age rather than just a trend, and the big data strategies are progressing from the testing stage to the implementation stage. In particular, as the importance of nonstandard data is increasing, limitations of the conventional system analysis appeared, and the analysis methods of advanced analytics are being highlighted. The scope of big data is anticipated to expand in enterprises with the emergence of many application cases, such as the real-time use of the data. The business model for the formation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the creative economy can assist the construction of an entrepreneurial platform as a catalyst for the stimulation of innovative business start-ups. This entrepreneurial platform can produce such effects as fast product development, commercialization of technology, risk reduction, and job creation. In this study, the operating model formation according to the characteristics of the industry or the business model in operation, the profit creation sources, the scope of value provision, and the priorities with regard to the required data were examined. Furthermore, cases related to the performance of big data business models of advanced corporations were examined, and a big data business model for the formation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the creative economy in the 21st century was derived. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.

Entrepreneurship is a powerful route to integrating skilled people into the working market. However, its teaching is particularly weak in engineering degree programmes. The objective of this innovative action has been to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem to improve ICT entrepreneurial skills at engineering universities of countries with weaker entrepreneurial tradition in new technologies.Anacceleration programme has been designed for engineering students with the objective of creating start-ups, going beyond the concept and becoming a start-up in early stage. Innovative methods have been applied to create and accelerate start-ups within an entrepreneurial ecosystem adapted to the university context. Four years of experience (2012-15) have allowed us to collect indicators and improving the proposed methods to scale up the model to the wider EU.Two hundred sixty-one students have participated in this experience and fifty-six start-ups have been created. Of those, thirty-eight have successfully finalized the programme. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.

The Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program engages students and faculty across Penn State in the rigorous research, design, field-testing, and launch of technologybased social enterprises that address global development challenges. HESE ventures are embedded in a series of five courses that integrate learning, research, and entrepreneurial engagement. The goal is to educate globally-engaged problem solvers who can create sustainable and scalable value for partnering communities, while simultaneously generating and disseminating new knowledge and lessons learned. This article describes the genesis, foundational philosophies, programmatic learning outcomes, and course mechanics of the HESE Program. The eplum model of student engagement, which embeds HESE sub-projects into regular credit classes and provides rigorous yet non-travelbased experiences to a cross section of students, is discussed. A mixed methods approach is utilized to examine the effectiveness and impact of the eplum curricular model on student learning, specifically in the areas of global awareness, multidisciplinary teamwork, and entrepreneurship education. The entrepreneurial and research outcomes of the program are summarized with a culminating discussion on the emergence of an educational and entrepreneurial ecosystem that has proved pivotal to actualize the ventures and achieve sustainable impact.

This paper, through literary assessment on evidence-based entrepreneurship (EBE), has categorized how systematic examination of phenomena puts a major barrier to the advancement of evidence- based entrepreneurship education (EBEE). The study being theoretical in nature, portraying an integrated conceptual framework on EBEE, we tried to explain a unique set of empirical phenomena containing factors necessary for promoting evidence-based practice in entrepreneurship education in a broader domain of management studies. Through qualitative analysis, we reviewed 89 articles on the current literature in the theme of EBE, EBEE, EBMgt, Entrepreneurial Intentions, Entrepreneurial Orientations and others. A generic description of the phenomenon-evidenced- based approach for entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education drawn from the variety of literature reviewed does not devalue the findings and legitimize EBEE to conclude it only as a research setting. We make an attempt to identify a series of congregating forces crafting entrepreneurial ecosystem for aspiring entrepreneurs and detecting trigger points to understand the complexities behind new venture creation. Given the importance of new venture formation in an economy, the findings provide an assessment from the public policymakers’ perspective for students dreaming about new venture and small business formation. Linking the findings in practical implication, we focus on public policy institutions to practice EBEE as a tool to design programs for entrepreneurship teaching practice that will score in dispensing evidence-based entrepreneurship knowledge (EBEK). Through a real life approach, considering “de novo” nature of entrepreneurship theory, we argue that practice in evidence-based modeling in entrepreneurship needs to be contextually embedded in the scholar-practitioner’s environment. By elucidating the scope of this field, the paper complements reasonable body of earlier research, adding more valuable points to the literature. © 2016 by De La Salle University.

Purpose: The emerging perspectives of entrepreneurial ecosystems, bricolage and effectuation highlight the interaction between the entrepreneur and the surrounding community, and its potential for creative resource acquisition and utilization. However, empirical work on how this process actually unfolds remains scarce. This paper aims to study the interaction between the opportunity construction process and the development of resources in the surrounding ecosystem. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a qualitative analysis of the extreme case of Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), a newly founded organization successfully promoting entrepreneurship within a university merger with virtually no resources, based on interviews of six key contributors and four stakeholder organizations. Findings: The opportunity construction process both supported and was supported by two key resource generating mechanisms. Formulating and opportunistically reformulating the agenda for increasing potential synergy laid the groundwork for mutual benefit. Proactive concretization enhanced both initial resource allocation and sustaining input to the process through offering tangible instances of specific opportunities and feedback. Research limitations/implications: Although based on a single case study in a university setting, proactive concretization emerges as a promising direction for further investigations of the benefits and dynamics of entrepreneur–ecosystem interaction in the opportunity construction process. Practical implications: Intentionally creating beneficial entrepreneur–ecosystem interaction and teaching proactive concretization becomes a key goal for educators of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The paper extends an understanding of creative resource generation and utilization in the opportunity construction process. The role of proactive concretization was emphasized in the interaction of the entrepreneur and the ecosystem, creating virtuous spirals of entrepreneurial activity. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Entrepreneurial activity is currently a primary concern of many developed economies that struggle with changes in their industrial structures. Many of the traditionally strong industries are encountering strong global competition and declining markets, and national competitiveness is often said to be built on new entrepreneurial firms that are able to grow in global markets. The facilitating national systems for these firms are covered in the emerging start-up ecosystem discussion. This chapter aims to contribute to this discussion by incorporating an analysis of the variety of actors and activities needed in start-up industries that rely on competence bloc theory. Furthermore, inspired by culturalhistorical activity theory, the study specifies the contextual-, temporaland renewal-related determinants of the activity of start-up ecosystems. As a result, a framework for examining start-up ecosystems as platforms for high-growth entrepreneurship is proposed in terms of its coreconstituencies that influence the emergence and non-emergence of highgrowth firms.

Emerging economies in the global economic arena are gaining growing importance. As the innovative capabilities in some of these economies are expanding, it is important to define and measure the complex nexus of entrepreneurship and innovation within the context of emerging economies.This paper is emphasizing on the macro level of analysis and organizational approach with regard to innovative capabilities of new businesses in a given contextual environment. The paper investigates how the innovative approaches of an entrepreneur influence his/her growth expectation within the contextual framework of an emerging economy, namely Turkey. By classifying entrepreneurial activity as Schumpeterian type of entrepreneurship (innovation based) and Kirznerian type of entrepreneurship (opportunity based) we aim to investigate if the motive for entrepreneurship has an influence of growth expectations. To embrace micro level analysis as well, individual characteristics of the entrepreneur, namely fear of failure, is also included.The data collected through the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) research program questionnaire was used in the analyses. In order to test the hypotheses developed, mixed model analyses was used. The results presented in this paper may be useful in understanding entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper has as its theme the collaborative spaces. Normally called "coworking spaces", these places aim to promote interaction, meeting and collaboration of entrepreneurs, startups, large companies, students and other partners. The main aim of this paper is to present CUBO, a new concept of coworking that was built to fill some gaps. Data were collected through documents and interviews. As a result, it was demonstrated that the coworking spaces, especially CUBO, can contribute to entrepreneurship, considering that it allows connections between stakeholders and promote a suitable environment for innovation and value creation.

Academic programs focused on engineering entrepreneurship are growing in number and popularity at American universities. However, the fields of engineering, entrepreneurship and technology-based entrepreneurship struggle to recruit and retain female students: a historic and endemic failure at obtaining gender-balanced participation. Understanding the motivations of women engaged in such academic programs can influence recruitment and retention strategies and lead to the creation of transformative learning environments and entrepreneurial ecosystems. This study investigates the motivations that women have for participating in the Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) program at Penn State. In this five-year study, females from diverse academic majors cited the following to be their top motivations for participating: a) becoming a global professional; b) making a difference; and c) applying theory learned in school to address a problem. In contrast, males cited 1) making a difference 2) participating in an exciting real-world project and 3) applying theory to address a problem, as their top motivations. Studying the motivations and perceptions of enterprising women and men provides compelling insights to help make academic engineering entrepreneurship programs more appealing to both female and male students.

Notable changes to human comfort are underway that add greatly to the complexity of existential processes. These are inter-ethnic violence and economic polarisation. Historically, these have resisted resilience from urban recovery in intractable contexts. Among the wicked problems confronting future actors and agents of newly emerging frontiers of research and policy are those addressing the dark side of innovation and entrepreneurship. This is seldom studied in economic geography but such are the negativities associated with so many dimensions of not only technology but its deformations and inhuman inversions that there will, for sure, be future growth for a wide range of social, natural, applied sciences and technology fixes for human dilemmas into the foreseeable future. We consider resilience in prefatory remarks on two intractable cases. Contrariwise, in this brief paper on new technological spaces, attention is devoted to two new cybersecurity spatial types, each of which consists in an under-explored dark side. In this, not in the long term, the naturally optimistic research outlook of the academic will be obscured by the demands of a more pessimistic outlook for the short term. Two of our selected sub-fields, in cyber-security and structured finance, reference both the dark web for illegal and terroristic communication and dark pools.

This paper analyses the development of university-business cooperation (UBC) in Finland in the context of the University Reform Act of 2009, drawing on the experience of four universities: Aalto University, University of Jyväskylä, University of Turku, and Lappeenranta University of Technology. Six UBC dimensions are examined: institutional context, stakeholders, motivations, facilitators/inhibitors, benefits, and drawbacks. We find that UBC, while a relatively recent process, is growing fast in dynamic local innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems. The University Act of 2009 had an uneven effect on the six UBC dimensions, with the most visible impact being manifested on motivations. Aalto University's leading position in UBC and strong capacity to raise public and private funding has a dual effect: while being a major achievement, it also tends to polarize the Finnish universities financially, through a Matthew effect that may slow down UBC development in other universities. © The Author 2016.

This chapter focuses on the impact that private-equity financing has on nurturing and developing global entrepreneurs in emerging economies. The research question is: how do potentially high-impact entrepreneurial start-ups in emerging economies rapidly expand globally in order to compete with developed-country competitors. Oviatt's and McDougall's (1994, 2005) international new venture typology is used to analyze a case study of an emerging-economy, born-global start-up and its relationship with a venture capital firm, which is crucial to develop a competitive international business strategy. In spite of operating in an emerging country lacking a well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystem (institutional void), a global start-up in conjunction with a venture capital firm that practiced a hands-on investment strategy, was able to successfully scale its business model globally over a 10-year period. The venture capital firm played a critical role in providing institutional support, lacking in this emerging country, to enable the startup to quickly grow and become competitive with Western competitors.

The framework for this study is based on the research and literature related to serial entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our sample is 12 serial entrepreneurs within a single context—the Waterloo Region—that has been ranked as one of the top start-up ecosystems in the world. In 2012, it was ranked 16th with 32 % of the start-ups identified as being led by serial entrepreneurs. The study provides an understanding of the characteristics that define a mature ecosystem, with specific input on the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. We profile the 12 entrepreneurs to provide a review of their businesses, the contributions they have made within their ecosystem, and their statements on what they have learned in the process of leading multiple ventures. This research may be useful for communities and nations that seek to focus on entrepreneurship as a means for economic growth. It should also stimulate further research on contextual issues and examine serial entrepreneurs within their own ecosystem. © 2016, Ensign and Farlow.

We focus on supply and the under-explored demand-side factors that help explicate cross-border expansion, the Multinational Enterprise (MNE) and organization. We explore how appropriability-informed and legacy-shaped entrepreneurial imagination motivates a process of creation and co-creation of the cross-border business context (such as markets, demand, and supporting infrastructures, including business ecosystems), and when feasible the wider institutional, regulatory and even cultural one, that conventional International Business (IB) literature takes as a datum. This is examined conceptually and by drawing on illustrative case examples. We claim that by focusing on agency, learning, intentionality and demand-side factors, our approach complements, and also challenges extant sometimes static, supply-side, agent-agnostic theories of the MNE and helps appreciate better phenomena such as market, demand and value creation, and co-creation, MNEs without firm specific advantages and born-global firms. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because the large majority of new ventures remain small, their economic contribution is questioned. Shane (Small Bus Econ 33(2):141–149, 2009) has argued that designing public policies which encourage more people to become entrepreneurs is counterproductive, and the exclusive focus should be high-growth ventures, or gazelles. As a counter to Shane’s position, four types of start-up ventures are considered, with each having differing needs and making unique contributions to the economic welfare of a nation, region, or locality. Based on this typology, seven counter-arguments to Shane’s position are presented, addressing issues related to the cost of entry and exit, rates of efficiency and failure, employment levels, sector differences, ecosystems, and venture emergence. Based on these counter-arguments, a portfolio perspective is advocated, where societal risks and a variety of returns are balanced across all four types of new ventures. An example of a portfolio approach to policy design is provided, and implications are drawn. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

With entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems appearing in geographic pockets around the world in diverse places and pockets of growth, the call for an entrepreneur-driven innovation ecosystem (EDIE) in Europe is long overdue. Change remains a constant, and traditional industries and mature markets in Europe have left a vacuum in the path to economic growth. The need for a new model is immediate. If Europe is to find itself providing competitive leadership in the global business environment, a new philosophy is necessary to move forward in the twenty-first century. This is the thinking behind the imperative for an EDIE in Europe, which is presented in this article as a result of a long established effort to awaken a European response to an increasingly contracting environment. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

US universities are leading the way in technology commercialization and licensing. This paper discusses the practice of licensing at the US universities, as well as the main directions and tasks of technology commercialization and licensing at the University of Maryland. Universities and research centers can implement steps to improve their technology commercialization and licensing negotiation by using solid analytical models. In the following sections, we suggest and describe a game-theoretic model to analyze, understand, and anticipate the behavioral profiles of inventors, entrepreneurs, and innovators on a dynamic interactive basis and in the context of a university or research center linkages with the market (of the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem) in pursuit of designing an optimal (or feasibly sub-optimal) licensing contract. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Abstract: Regional policies for entrepreneurship are currently going through a transition from increasing the quantity of entrepreneurship to increasing the quality of entrepreneurship. The next step will be the transition from entrepreneurship policy towards policy for an entrepreneurial economy. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach has been heralded as a new framework accommodating these transitions. This approach starts with the entrepreneurial actor, but emphasizes the context of productive entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is not only the output of the system, entrepreneurs are important players themselves in creating the ecosystem and keeping it healthy. This research briefing reviews the entrepreneurial ecosystem literature and its shortcomings, and provides a novel synthesis. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach speaks directly to practitioners, but its causal depth and evidence base is rather limited. This article provides a novel synthesis including a causal scheme of how the framework and systemic conditions of the ecosystem lead to particular entrepreneurial activities as output of the ecosystem and new value creation as outcome of the ecosystem. In addition it provides a framework for analysing the interactions between the elements within the ecosystem. This offers a much more rigorous and relevant starting point for subsequent studies into entrepreneurial ecosystems and the regional policy implications of these. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Purpose – Entrepreneurship ecosystems could be useful road maps for the formulation of entrepreneurship policies for countries in Africa. The twenty-first century economic development agenda lay a lot of emphasis on the pivotal role that entrepreneurship plays in the growth of economies, job creation and poverty alleviation especially in Africa. But without the right entrepreneurial ecosystems to enhance the formulation of pertinent entrepreneurship policies, achieving entrepreneurial economic growth will be difficult. The existing frameworks for the development of entrepreneurship ecosystems are based on research that has been conducted elsewhere. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Entrepreneurship research in Africa has rarely focused in understanding and evaluating the entrepreneurship ecosystems. In this paper, we have attempted to examine the present state of the entrepreneurship ecosystems in four countries (Botswana, Egypt, Ghana and Uganda) in Africa. Despite the fact that extant literature on the concept is limited, it has been reviewed to provide a picture of entrepreneurship ecosystems. Relevant national and international documents were also examined to evaluate the present state of entrepreneurship ecosystems in these countries. Findings – The findings from each of the countries though they depict a static situation, justify the proposition that entrepreneurs are omnipresent, it is only the entrepreneurship environment that accounts for the differences in entrepreneurial economic growth and the cross-countries comparisons shows the dissimilarities in national entrepreneurship environments. Research limitations/implications – In conclusion, a broad process to develop entrepreneurship ecosystems initiatives is suggested alongside the crucial roles that governments and other stakeholders should play which implies that a National Entrepreneurship Mission might be necessary. Originality/value – Multiple case studies that have compared entrepreneurship ecosystems of countries in Africa are very rare. This study though explorative, is one of the first. The findings and conclusions could be useful for a detailed study to map out pertinent and self sustaining entrepreneurship ecosystems that are necessary for the formulation of entrepreneurship policies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The desire of communities and nations is their ability to exercise their prowess in terms of their wealth and ability to create wealth for a meaningful economic context. Entrepreneurship success cannot be achieved by a singly identifiable factor or else it would be standardized for achievement anywhere and elsewhere. Factor homogeneity has never been well-known for a universal economic development and, therefore, the appreciation of differences in unlikely environments may remain for some time, unless, otherwise. This paper attempts to underscore the fact that entrepreneurship thrives under a holistic set of components and cycles, formally called the ecosystem. Through literature review and the presentation of the existence of various models the paper paints a view of the holistic environment desirable for an entrepreneurial flair to be achieved. In this presentation, a suggested model for entrepreneurial flair development is advanced. It is the proposition of this paper that a holistic view in the pedagogy of entrepreneurship should not be limited to entrepreneurship teaching perse rather on the entrepreneurial flair even as no single component acts by itself in an entrepreneurial environment. Therefore, whichever component tends to have higher impact on a given area calls for further study and appreciation. © John Amolo, Stephen. O Migiro, 2015.

Research on the economic impact of entrepreneurship makes the case for entrepreneur-focused economic development. Community economic development practitioners and policy-makers face the challenge of identifying and implementing the most promising strategies. Some community development researchers have argued effectively for an entrepreneurial development system, or ecosystem, approach as a way to build and grow a pipeline of entrepreneurial talent. Others document the importance of building community capacity as a prerequisite for the establishment of an effective ecosystem. This paper draws on field-based learning, primarily in Kansas and Australia, to develop the conceptual underpinnings for an approach to creating entrepreneurial communities that builds: (1) the capacity of the community to host and support an entrepreneurial ecosystem and (2) the capacity of entrepreneurs to grow themselves and their businesses in support of community economic development. © 2015 Community Development Society.

This study suggests that in the entrepreneurial communities of emerging industries, individual entrepreneurs may simultaneously create opportunities that spill over to others and discover opportunities already created by others. Extant opportunity literature, focused on single actors and their personal networks or on the information function of market prices, is largely mute on the role of opportunities in value networks with distributed entrepreneurial efforts. Ecosystem theory, a literature stream that seldom intersects opportunity literature, contributes with a conceptual framework to study the question. The paper seeks to shed light on how opportunities are created or discovered by new ventures as they are involved in the interlinked endeavor of forming a new ecosystem. The study examines five case studies of US ventures in the early phase of the solar service industry, an industry in which entrepreneurs offer customers access to solar panels as a service rather than as a product. These ventures inadvertently created an industry ecosystem together, as they could not protect the value created by their business partners' new knowledge, or by the emerging social webs between partners. They shaped opportunities together, passing value back and forth amongst themselves. This paper offers fundamental observations on how opportunity creation and discovery is distributed among a community of entrepreneurs as a business ecosystem grows. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates the role of the ICT ecosystem within the informal business sectors of rural and urban Jamaica, relying on an exploratory collective case study methodology to highlight the differences in how the use of mobile phones have facilitated and enhanced entrepreneurial opportunities for business operators existing in the informal economy. The findings of the study confirm existing research about the socio-economic benefits of ICTs but also highlight specific characteristics related to informal ICT ecosystems. For example, we found that there was a close-knit set of entrepreneurs who were motivated by competition between one another but who would still engage in mutual learning and information sharing. These ecosystems also entail a system of social hierarchy among the actors, although there is potential for mobility. Finally, we note that our findings suggest a potential reconsideration of definitions of the informal sector that emphasize low-skilled labour.

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical overview of the current state of entrepreneurship education (EE) in Australia; placing emphasis on programs, curricula and entrepreneurship ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach – The authors performed a contextual review of the literature by delineating entrepreneurship education programs, the entrepreneurial ecosystem and EE learning and teaching. The review was enhanced by a systematic collection of data from higher education institutions web sites, depicting the prevailing situation of entrepreneurship programs, courses, subjects and their ecosystems. Findings – A number of interesting findings emerged from this study. From a curricular perspective, Australian universities offer 584 subjects related to entrepreneurship. This includes dominance at undergraduate level, representing 24 minors/majors and specializations in entrepreneurship. In total, 135 entrepreneurship ecosystems were identified. Research limitations/implications – This paper presents findings from university web sites and as such requires introspection to validate individual university offerings. Practical implications – The study provides the status of EE in Australia, and may guide academic and policy decision makers to further develop entrepreneurship initiatives. Originality/value – This paper provides the first analytical overview of EE in Australia and paves the way for further evaluation. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose-A career at the professional, elite level in sports does not last forever. One way or another, the day comes when players have to hang up their boots and move on, but to what? Some stay in the sport as managers or coaches, become broadcast announcers, or use their name recognition to pitch a product. However, for many their future opportunities lie in entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of the entrepreneurial learning needs of professional rugby players preparing for a career transition and asks the following questions: What are the specific needs of professional athletes in relation to entrepreneurial learning?, and, what are the key elements of designing an entrepreneurship programme to meet these needs? Design/methodology/approach-The author adopted an interpretivist philosophical standpoint for this research, with an inductive research approach to explore various components of a tailored entrepreneurship training programme called the “Certificate in Enterprise Potential” (CEP) using the process of emergent inquiry. This programme was designed specifically for professional rugby athletes in Ireland. In gathering the data for the case study, the author pursued established principles of data collection, and used multiple sources of evidence. Findings-The findings provide evidence of the entrepreneurial learning needs of professional athletes in career transition and identifies the key elements to be considered when designing an entrepreneurship programme to meet these needs. The findings are presented under the headings context, objectives and outcomes, audience, content, pedagogy, assessment and evaluation. Research limitations/implications-There are multiple implications from this study. For entrepreneurship educators, the various components of designing a tailored entrepreneurship programme for professional athletes are identified and outlined. For researchers, it opens the door for research with other sports people from different contexts. For professional athletes and professionals working with athletes, it provides evidence of a non-athletic and an entrepreneurial career transition model that builds on the player’s social identity, social networks and taps into an existing HEI entrepreneurship ecosystem. The research was confined to a single case study for a specific target audience and needs replication with other cohorts in order to reduce the chance of these findings being unique to one single case. Originality/value-This paper focuses on the career transition and mid-career aspect of entrepreneurship education and in particular the career transition needs of the professional athletes. These findings provide a deeper understanding of mid-career entrepreneurship education, specifically in the contexts of professional athletes and HEI’s. Many athletes are forced to end their sporting careers early and with little hope of a meaningful or alternative long-term career options. This paper goes some way in addressing this concern. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Innovative data sources offer new ways of studying spatial and temporal industrial and regional development. Our approach is to study the development of an entrepreneurial regional economy through a comprehensive analysis of its constituent firms and institutions over time. Our study region is defined by the location of large multinationals recruited to North Carolina's Research Triangle Park and the adjacent area. We have built a database of 4200 technology-intensive entrepreneurial firms that draws on over 30 distinct data sources and includes details on company founders, annual firm employment and engagement with the entrepreneurial ecosystem. By outlining our approach in this paper, our primary objective is to create a transferable framework for analyzing regional dynamics in other locations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Knight and Cavusgil's award-winning article has played an important role in the development of the growing body of research on companies that internationalize early and rapidly. These "born global" firms represent important contributors to many economies, often as key players in ecosystems that support large multinational enterprises. Despite their growing importance, our understanding of how and why these firms develop and implement their internationalization strategies, and what makes them successful, remains incomplete. Addressing such questions has contributed substantially to the development of the research domain of international entrepreneurship (IE), which focuses on entrepreneurial aspects of doing business across borders, in the context of both small and large firms. While IE is much broader than born globals, these firms are central to the IE domain and the impact of the Knight and Cavusgil paper has helped to develop a stronger awareness of the important linkages and intersections between IE and the wider international business research community. We reflect on the important contribution of this paper, and suggest some directions for the future development of research into firms that choose to operate internationally practically from the start of their operations. © 2015 Academy of International Business.

The business incubators have an essential role at any global entrepreneurial ecosystem. Through the support offered to entrepreneurs in terms of infrastructure and management, they reduce mortality risk of startup companies and contribute to better performance of the country’s economy. In order to make a contribution to the academia and to business incubators, this paper is primarily engaged in performing a literature review on Brazilian and international academic basis in order to identify which are the main themes of research conducted involving Brazilian business incubators. The results show that most of the themes are associated with the services provision by the incubators and its management; however, there are many gaps yet to be explored by academic researchers, such as internal characteristics or the interrelationship between business incubators and triple helix. © 2015, Universidad Alberto Hurtado.

This paper examines the relationship between biomedical policies and entrepreneurial R&D strategies. Public health programs have been unable to provide effective and affordable treatment of infectious diseases for the poor. While governments have become more open to private sector contributions to policy objectives, it is rare to find new ventures commercializing healthcare innovations for neglected diseases. Two case studies of entrepreneurial ventures, in the UK and China, provide evidence on how resource-constrained firms mobilize participants in policy-specific ecosystems to achieve their goals of new vaccine development for tuberculosis. Ecosystem analysis reveals how the innovators’ business models can align their strategies with national policy objectives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd

This study evaluates the effects of a community-based entrepreneurship training program on the entrepreneurial passion (EP) and networking frequency of military veterans. Pre-test and post-test surveys were completed by military veterans who received scholarships to attend a 10-week structured course. These veterans also participated in business mentoring sessions with local business entrepreneurs for an additional nine months. The results demonstrate that the program significantly improved the veterans' entrepreneurial passion scores, as well as raised the level of networking behavior. These findings provide additional validation for the EP survey instrument and contribute to the understanding of integrating military veterans into a civilian-based entrepreneurship ecosystem that provides access to business resources and in turn increases entrepreneurial passion. © 2014.

Purpose: There are strong similarities and striking differences in Estonia’s and South Korea’s entrepreneurial ecosystems. The purpose of this paper is to seek to compare and contrast these two economies in terms of key indicators related to impacts, performance measures and determinants of entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this study can be described as theory building from multiple case studies. The analysis is based on secondary data from a number of sources related to impacts, performance measures and determinants of entrepreneurship. Findings: Among the major findings is that in order to shift to a higher gear, South Korea’s entrepreneurial weakness must be addressed through broad institutional reforms that include the corporate governance, and policies and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. In Estonia’s case, while continuing attention must be paid to institutional reforms, immediate action is needed to improve policies that affect basic economic, technological and infrastructural conditions. Research limitations/implications: A crucial lesson from a comparison of these two economies is that multiple paths of entrepreneurial success exist. Practical implications: The lessons each can learn from the other to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem are suggested. Other emerging, developing and less developed economies also have much to learn from the success paths of these two economies. Originality/value: This paper provides unique insights into alternative ways that emerging economies can follow to develop successful entrepreneurial ecosystems and achieve entrepreneurial success as well as advantages and limitations of the alternatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In light of the projected long-term national economic trends, the vulnerability of rural regions, and the difficulty of small businesses to stay solvent, it is imperative to understand the critical elements within a small business' operating environment or "ecosystem" that support or thwart entrepreneurial activity. Using the 100 counties of North Carolina as a case study, the purpose of this research project was to determine which entrepreneurial ecosystem elements (E3) have the most influence on tourism and entrepreneurship, to identify spatial patterns in this relationship, as well as the extent to which entrepreneurial and tourist activity overlap regionally. Using national secondary data sources, the authors identified that the interaction of entrepreneurship with the proportion of those employed in the creative class is strongly associated with the growth in the number of new establishments and employment, particularly in those rural counties endowed with attractive outdoor amenities. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The purpose of this article and the special issue is to improve our understanding of the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications of entrepreneurial innovation. We accomplish this objective by examining the role of context in stimulating such activity, as well as its impact on the outcomes of entrepreneurial innovation. Our analysis begins by outlining an overarching framework for entrepreneurial innovation and context. With reference to this framework we then compare the attributes of national innovation systems, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial innovation, and categorize contextual influences on entrepreneurial innovation. We then situate the papers presented in this special issue within this framework. We conclude by outlining an agenda for additional research on this topic, focusing on the relationships between contexts and entrepreneurial innovation and then discuss policy implications, focusing on how public and private actors can meet these challenges. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In 2013, the University of Strathclyde became the first Scottish university to receive the prestigious THES UK Entrepreneurial University of the Year award. In this article, I describe how successful technology commercialization education in this leading UK-based technological university is deeply dependent on the state of the university’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. Two case studies illustrate the relatively minor “supporting” role that conventional teaching plays in the practice of technology commercialization, and the major role that a comprehensive university entrepreneurial ecosystem can play. Lessons drawn from teaching and learning technology commercialization at the University of Strathclyde are discussed. These include “teaching by stealth” through the ecosystem, basing students’ class assignments on their own technology, and the use of local role models in class. I conclude by summarizing today’s challenges and opportunities facing Strathclyde’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

In 2004 and 2007, the Kauffman Foundation awarded 18 universities and colleges $3-5 million dollars each to develop radiant model entrepreneurship education programs and campus-wide entrepreneurial ecosystems. Grant recipients were required to have a senior level administrator to oversee the program who reported to the Provost, President, or Chancellor. Award recipients included Syracuse University (2007) and the University of Rochester (2004). Cornell was not a Kauffman campus. This chapter explores three case studies in the radiant model of university-wide entrepreneurship education as deployed at Cornell University, The University of Rochester, and Syracuse University. The authors examine the history, accelerators, and challenges of the radiant model of university-wide entrepreneurship education. Copyright © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Since the 1980s, US universities have greatly increased attention given to innovation and entrepreneurship out of a genuine commitment to enhancing American competitiveness. Although regional innovation and entrepreneurship can be enhanced by universities in multiple ways, the primary metrics of "success" remain patenting, licensing rates, and university spin-outs. While these metrics can be a useful proxy for the entrepreneurial university they tend to understate the many important contributions universities, including non-research intensive universities, make to their regional economies. In this chapter, we introduce a framework of capabilities that are essential to nurturing ecosystems of innovation and entrepreneurship at the regional level. We then describe the varied ways in which universities can support the development of these capabilities. Finally, we provide a framework of metrics, which can more comprehensively capture the value that universities represent to innovation and entrepreneurship in their regions.

Saudi Arabia embarks the transition from conventional economy into a knowledge-based economy. This implies improving the national innovation capacity and developing an ecosystem for techno-entrepreneurs. In this regard, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology has established a national technology business incubation program; BADIR Program for Technology Incubators. BADIR aims to encourage non-oil based industry economic growth and foster knowledge growth and innovation-based startups. BADIR helps cultivate innovative ideas contributed by Saudi technoentrepreneurs as incubator members and enables them to scale their technology for industrialization and commercialization, and to benefit from the economic growth. This program to date has successfully assisted many technological incubators in a structured way. © Content Management Pty Ltd.

Stanford University's legendary success in technology transfer, based upon a relatively small group of serial faculty entrepreneurs, masked unrealized potential residing in the underutilized inventions of less entrepreneurially experienced faculty and students. An optimum academic entrepreneurship and technology-transfer regime matches various levels of inventor interest and involvement with appropriate organizational competence and support. The 'Paradox of Success' is that great organizational success in licensing, or other activities, may reduce the motivation to further advancement, in the Stanford case, introducing support structures for research commercialization that are commonplace in aspiring entrepreneurial universities. Stanford had largely bought into an ideology of a self-organizing innovation ecosystem in Silicon Valley that implied lack of need for explicit entrepreneurial support structures on campus, such as incubator facilities. This belief inhibited policy intervention until a student-organized accelerator project actualizing underutilized entrepreneurial capacity demonstrated that a step change in promoting entrepreneurship at Stanford was necessary and feasible. Case studies based on archival and interview data show the development of Stanford's entrepreneurial academic culture and university development strategy. © The Author(s) 2013.

Healthcare innovations for bottom-of-pyramid populations face considerable risks and few economic incentives. Can entrepreneurial innovators provide new solutions for global health? This chapter examines how a technology enterprise built a collaborative network and supportive ecosystem making it possible to steer an innovation for TB patients through discovery, development, and delivery. Ecosystem resources were mobilized and upstream and downstream co-innovation risks were mitigated to commercialize a new diagnostic test. Detailed evidence on this innovation for TB care uses ecosystem analysis to clarify core issues in the context of joint value creation. The case study shows how resources from private and public partners can be leveraged and combined by the focal firm to build joint value and to lower execution, co-innovation, and adoption risks in healthcare ecosystems combating diseases of poverty.

The Proof of Concept phase in university technology transfer is considered to be critical for the success of both licensing and the creation of spin-off companies. In the United States, Proof of Concept Centers are emerging as successful structures to address the challenges of this phase. In this paper, we present a framework to assess the role for such a structure in a university ecosystem. The framework is built from previous references that we use to explicitly link the features of Proof of Concept Centers with the challenges of the Proof of Concept phase, and establish their specific contributions to the overall technology commercialization efforts of a university. We illustrate the application of this framework in a case study of the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, and develop a characterization that is representative of the role that a Proof of Concept Center can play in comparable university ecosystems that feature conventional technology commercialization structures, and struggle with the challenges of the Proof of Concept phase. Our study suggests that there is in fact a possible role for a Proof of Concept Center in the regional ecosystem of the University of Coimbra, with a potentially very relevant impact in the technology commercialization process, through networking outside academia and research environments, funding of Proof of Concept activities, and technology entrepreneurship education for the development of entrepreneurial skills for researchers. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Numerous studies focus on successful clusters to demonstrate that geographic proximity enables collaboration and innovation. Yet, practitioners still need to understand why some clusters fail to collaborate despite their geographic proximity. This longitudinal study investigates an ICT public-private innovation cluster that fails to collaborate and explores how geographic, institutional, organizational, cognitive and social proximities interplay. The findings show that: (1) social proximity is the most important proximity to achieving collaboration; (2) close geographic proximity can be a barrier to social proximity; and (3) geographic distance is seen as an accelerator of entrepreneurship and innovation. These findings contribute to the literature on clusters and innovation by arguing that contexts of high cognitive, organizational, institutional and geographic proximities do not facilitate communication and collaboration. Specifically, geographic proximity can have a negative impact on social proximity. Finally the paper illustrates that clusters created by economic policies are less prone to innovation compared to spontaneous ecosystems emerging from private entrepreneurial initiatives. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we introduce the concept of entrepreneurial capability (EC) to capture a firm's capacity to sense, select, and shape opportunities, and synchronize their strategic moves and resources in pursuit of these opportunities. We define EC and explain its dimensions, highlighting its role in achieving and sustaining a firm's competitive advantage. We also propose that EC is instrumental for realizing a firm's game-changing strategies, that is, those strategic moves that fundamentally alter the nature, domain and dynamics of competition. Furthermore, we propose that strategic leadership plays an essential role in honing a company's EC and aligning it with its game-changing strategy by creating an organizational context where transforming the business ecosystem becomes feasible. Finally, we articulate the implications of EC for managerial practices and for advancing future research at the intersection of entrepreneurship, leadership, and competitive strategy. © Baker College 2013.

The significance of entrepreneurship has come into sharper focus as enterprise and innovation are being flagged as solutions to regenerate the Irish economy. The Irish Innovation Task Force believes that Ireland could become an ‘innovation hub’, attracting foreign risk capital and international and indigenous entrepreneurs to start and grow companies in Ireland. To realize these ambitions, Ireland needs to create a favourable and stable ecosystem for entrepreneurs through policy, tax, regulation, supply of finance, education and R&D. Irish higher education institutions are being exhorted to play a pivotal role in the development of an enterprise culture through entrepreneurship education (EE) and the production of graduate entrepreneurs. If HEIs are to contribute to Ireland's economic recovery they need to produce graduates capable of applying their knowledge to start and grow their own businesses. Existing paradigms provide an inadequate understanding of the complexities inherent in the provision of entrepreneurship education in Irish HEIs and its role in producing greater numbers of graduate entrepreneurs. There is a need to bridge the credibility gap between government expectations and harsh entrepreneurial realities to determine whether EE is having a positive impact on graduate enterprise development. This paper focuses on EE in Irish higher education and addresses the difficulty of measuring its effectiveness in producing graduate entrepreneurs. © 2012, © 2012 SAGE Publications.

Success in business ecosystems that include well-established companies and new ventures requires collaboration and competition, a task that demands strategic thinking to leverage a firm's resources and capabilities. Strategic thinking and the entrepreneurial activities in an ecosystem influence one another in a cycle that perpetuates and even sparks innovation. These interactions vary significantly across four types of business ecosystems-Orchestra, Creative Bazaar, Jam Central, and MOD Station-and determine the success and failures of new ventures and established companies. The nature and effect of the dynamic interactions in a business ecosystem can have profound implications for organizational success. © 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

The 'triple helix' of the university-industry-government relationship and habitat are accepted as important determinants of innovation and entrepreneurship. However, empirical explorations of the effects of these variables and their interrelationships on regional entrepreneurial activities are highly limited. To fill this gap, we investigate the effect of the triple helix system and habitat on birth and death rates of U.S. firms at the state level. As expected, we find that industrial R&D expenditure plays an important role in promoting regional firm birth. However, university and government R&D also generate a synergistic effect that indirectly influences regional firm birth rates. In addition, we find that the synergy between university and industrial R&D enhances the sustainability of firms, while the interactions between (1) university and government R&D and (2) government and industrial R&D are associated with an increase in firm death. Other factors linked to more favorable conditions for firm formation include higher educational attainment in a region, lower tax rate, and habitat factors affecting quality of life, such as lower housing prices and higher rates of health insurance coverage. In regions with high entrepreneurial activity, we find positive synergistic effects of the interactions between (1) university and government R&D and (2) university and industrial R&D on firm birth rate, suggesting that university R&D plays an important role as an 'entrepreneurial mediator' among the three spheres in the triple helix system. In low entrepreneurial regions, the only triple helix system factors significantly influencing firm birth rate were tax rate. This finding suggests that the independent and interdependent components of the triple helix system and habitat are less powerful in low entrepreneurial regions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This article is a personal remembrance by the authors, of John Freeman's transition from being a scholar on organization theory to an active contributor to entrepreneurship research, teaching and mentoring. The article reflects on Freeman's work on organizational ecology and entrepreneurship, as faculty director of the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, as he turned the focus of the Center to new venture formation. The article narrates how Freeman came to regard new venture creation as a defined management process for the new class of business manager, the professional entrepreneur, and points out his extension of the entrepreneurial process beyond the individual to the team and even to the ecosystem. © The Author 2012.

The ultimate value of this study is to help us understand the economic impact of the entrepreneurial ventures of university graduates. We know that some universities play an important role in many economies through their core education, research and development, and other spillovers. However, in order to support economic growth through entrepreneurship, universities must create a culture and programs that make entrepreneurship widely accessible to students. While MIT's leadership in developing successful entrepreneurs has been evident anecdotally, this study - one of the largest surveys of entrepreneur alumni ever conducted - quantifies the significant impact of MIT's entrepreneurial ecosystem that supports firm start-ups. Furthermore, while MIT is more unique and unusual in the programs it offers and in its historical culture of entrepreneurship, MIT provides a benchmark by which other institutions can gauge the economic impact of their alumni entrepreneurs. The report also provides numerous examples of programs and practices that might be adopted, intact or modified as needed, by other universities that seek enhanced entrepreneurial development. The Appendix identifies several universities that have carried out surveys of alumni entrepreneurs. © 2011 Edward B. Roberts.

Europe is highly competitive when it comes to developing new knowledge, but it is less successful at turning this knowledge into the innovative products and services that drive world class economies. The EU wants Europe to become a more innovationfriendly continent and is currently working on a new strategy to create an "Innovation Union". This LERU paper presents the views of some of Europe's leading research-intensive universities (RIUs) as a contribution to the development of the EU strategy and the initiatives that will follow from it. Research-intensive universities, as the bedrock of internationally competitive, cutting edge research and an attraction pole for a vast and dynamic pool of talented researchers, have an important role to play in the Innovation Union. However, in recent decades their research efforts have been impoverished, with some notable exceptions, in comparison with other systems because of marginal-cost funding of research, the allocation of research funding on criteria other than excellence, and an obsession with bureaucratic even-handedness. The EU can help universities flourish by developing or promoting processes and infrastructures that stimulate and enable creativity. Efforts should be focused on five objectives: 1) stimulating excellence by investing heavily and wisely in competitive, frontier, undirected research; 2) attracting and nurturing the best talents for research of each generation; 3) creating a barrier-free space for European researchers to move around in; 4) ensuring the development of and access to major, state-of-the-art research infrastructures; 5) orchestrating collaboration in globally significant research programmes. When it comes to creating an environment that allows innovation to flourish, universities play an important enabling role in the innovation chain. RIUs in particular are hubs of creativity which attract research-intensive companies and investment into a region and help to catalyse innovation in local businesses. They have developed strong technology transfer offices (TTOs) that act as entrepreneurial hubs throughout the entire innovation network around RIUs. Within the university, TTOs are not just the centrepiece of the university's third mission operations. Because of the cognitive and financial spillovers that TTOs generate, their activities interweave across the first and second missions of research-intensive universities. If universities are to be more effective in enabling and catalysing innovation in Europe, action is required under three broad headings that reflect the interaction between supply and demand. We suggest that these should be the priorities for the university component in a European innovation union. These headings are 1) enhancing supply of relevant university capacity, 2) stimulating business demand and 3) improving university-business interactions. While universities in general and RIUs in particular play an important role in the innovation chain, they do not operate in isolation but are instead part of a larger innovation ecosystem. There are fundamentally four different, but interacting forces at work in driving innovation. These driving forces are: 1) competitively driven research, 2) dynamic entrepreneurship, 3) competitive, fair market environments and 4) adequate financial resources. We propose that the EU's efforts to create a better innovation-friendly environment should consist of a four-pronged attack aimed at stimulating these four driving forces and that they should focus on the combination and interaction of these forces. © 2010 Published by LERU.

The purpose of this paper is threefold: To add to the description of the architecture of the US entrepreneurial system originally charted by Schramm (2004), discuss the link between market structure and innovation and stress the significance of incentives for invention and innovation. It is stated that entrepreneurship in the USA is governed by five factors: (1) venturefunding, as well as personal savings and capital democratisation, (2) established large firms, (3) government, (4) universities and (5) ecosystems. In turn, the paper reexamines, theoretically, the assertions that (a) although less competitive firms can realise significant profits from innovations, they bring them to market late and (b) more competitive firms are more likely to pursue cost-reducing process innovation. Finally, the paper focuses on society's motivation to grant patents, copyrights and trademarks as incentives for inventive and innovative activity. Although the paper adds to the architecture mentioned above, its contribution is mostly pedagogical in nature; it is hoped that it would be of some value to students in business and economics, as well as to entrepreneurs, business managers and governmental agents who are in charge of business and economic development. ©2009.

Firms such as Facebook, Google and MySpace are rapidly emerging as leaders of what is known as the ‘Web 2.0’ era of commerce. The common distinguishing characteristic of these firms is the primary basis of the value they provide, namely a forum for iterative collaboration and interactive content creation and modification for users. Their strategies underlie an important, currently unfolding phenomenon - that of ‘value co-creation’ and a transformation in the way value is created and experienced by producers and consumers. It is the intent of this article to analyse this phenomenon and its implications for entrepreneurial opportunities. Drawing from an interdisciplinary body of literature in networked organisations, Web 2.0 technologies and innovation, we identify the trends driving this transformation, the process by which it is accomplished and its outcomes. Our analysis lays out a theoretically grounded explanation for the occurrence of value co-creation and consequent opportunities for entrepreneurship, and provides direction for future research. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper draws on the social and behavioral sciences in an endeavor to specify the nature and microfoundations of the capabilities necessary to sustain superior enterprise performance in an open economy with rapid innovation and globally dispersed sources of invention, innovation, and manufacturing capability. Dynamic capabilities enable business enterprises to create, deploy, and protect the intangible assets that support superior long- run business performance. The microfoundations of dynamic capabilities - the distinct skills, processes, procedures, organizational structures, decision rules, and disciplines - which undergird enterprise-level sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capacities are difficult to develop and deploy. Enterprises with strong dynamic capabilities are intensely entrepreneurial. They not only adapt to business ecosystems, but also shape them through innovation and through collaboration with other enterprises, entities, and institutions. The framework advanced can help scholars understand the foundations of long-run enterprise success while helping managers delineate relevant strategic considerations and the priorities they must adopt to enhance enterprise performance and escape the zero profit tendency associated with operating in markets open to global competition.

Most organizations find that their ability to identify and innovatively exploit opportunities decreases as they move from the entrepreneurial to the growth phase. However, the key to success in the highly competitive and dynamic environment that most companies presently operate in is to retain this ability. Therefore, companies need to adopt an entrepreneurial strategy — seeking competitive advantage through continuous innovation to effectively exploit identified opportunities — in order to sustain and grow under such circumstances. For such a strategy to succeed, companies should develop an enabling economic and political ecosystem that does not impede small or large scale redeployment of resources in new ways towards creative, entrepreneurial ends. Companies have a range of options to choose from to achieve this objective. At the one end of this option spectrum is ‘focused entrepreneurship’ wherein specific innovation initiatives are created with the rest of the organization insulated from them. At the other end is a managerial approach that leads to the creation of ‘organization-wide entrepreneurship.’ Entrepreneurship in such organizations is a shared value and drives managerial behaviour in conscious and subconscious ways and creates an entrepreneurial spirit organization-wide. Many mature organizations, unwilling to alter the status quo, tend to create focused initiatives that are mandated to identify and exploit new opportunities. While such focused initiatives may stimulate innovation, the very nature of their design erects barriers between the existing organization and the innovation effort. This makes it difficult for the organizations to access and leverage the existing capability base and to integrate new initiatives back into operational activity. Companies intent on developing and preserving entrepreneurship organization-wide, independent of their stage of growth, create an environment in which those who believe in the attractiveness of opportunities feel encouraged to pursue them. The top managements of such companies will design an organizational context conducive to autonomous generation of entrepreneurial initiatives, provide a sense of overall direction to these initiatives, and ensure that promising ventures receive necessary resources as they move through the uncertain development process wherein: ‣ money is neither offered nor seen as a primary motivator ‣ entrepreneurial contributions are rewarded with recognition and through provision of opportunities to engage in entrepreneurial activities on a bigger scale ‣ failure is considered normal and when failure occurs, the focus is on problem solving and learning from it rather than apportioning blame ‣ appropriate processes are used to capture knowledge created in the innovation process and routines developed to enable integration of such knowledge to create organizational rents. The contrast between patterns of focused and organization-wide entrepreneurship runs across every element of the organization starting with its mission and covering strategy, structure, systems, processes, and people skills and attitude. Institutionalizing the elements of entrepreneurship is crucial to building a sustaining competitive organization in today’s business environment. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

Travel-stimulated entrepreneurial migration involves the movement of existing and potential businesses to a region by entrepreneurs who first visited it while on pleasure or business travel. The incidence of travel-stimulated entrepreneurship is examined within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These pleasure and business travel-stimulated entrepreneurs are compared with native-Montana entrepreneurs regarding types of businesses they operate and their business location values. The findings indicate that travel-stimulated entrepreneurial migration contributes to business formation and diversity of firms competing in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The concept of travel-stimulated entrepreneurial migration is discussed with respect to conversion studies, economic impact models, and the tourism destination life-cycle model. -Authors
